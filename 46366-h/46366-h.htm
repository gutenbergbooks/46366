<p class='c006' >“Look out! There he comes!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Leaning far forward, riding a little black
object along the ice in the crook of his stick, the
blades of his skates throwing a fine spray of ice
as he swerved to right and left, Carl Hemmer,
Taber High’s great hockey star, was in the
midst of one of his famed solo dashes. An
amazing individual performer, Carl had twice
split Howard Prep’s defense wide open, charging
recklessly in on her goalie to smack the puck
into the net. There was nothing he relished
more than disconcerting the enemy and the entire
Howard sextet was certainly frantically bewildered
at his maneuvers. No team had, thus
far, been able to keep Carl bottled up. Irrepressible
in nature, he defied opposing sixes to
stop him—combining daring with superb stick
handling and dazzling skating. The tougher
the going, the more it stimulated him, Carl possessing
the ability to rise to all situations.</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’ll get him this time!” said Bentley,
Howard’s right defense, grimly.</p>

<p class='c007' >He stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Morton,
Prep’s left defense, both of whom were smarting
under previous assaults.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Get him if you have to dump him!” answered
Morton. “That boy’s been going
through us like tissue paper!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Disdaining an attempt to go around the
human bulwark of the two forms huddled to
impede his progress, Carl—going at top speed—crouched
for the impact. Spectators were up
on their feet, thrilled at the spectacle Carl was
presenting. He was actually a one-man team.
Taber hadn’t lost a game since his advent in
school and ice hockey, through his exploits, had
become the town’s most popular sport.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Hit ’em high! Hit ’em low!” sung the
Taber rooters, as though they were cheering a
football team.</p>

<p class='c007' >It was the third period of a game in which
Taber led, three to one. No necessity for Carl’s
tempestuous drive down the ice except that his
dynamic nature sent him always on the attack
whenever he could get his stick on the puck.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Worry the enemy every minute of the
game,” had been his motto, “and the enemy
won’t worry you!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Smack!</p>

<p class='c007' >Howard Prep’s two defense men met the
whizzing Carl Hemmer head-on. This time
Taber High’s crack hockey player did not go
through. Instead his body was catapulted backwards,
with pieces of broken sticks flying in air,
to land heavily some feet away and go skidding
across the ice to bring up with a sickening thud
against the sideboards.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Wow! They certainly stopped him that
time!” breathed a spectator. “Looked like
dirty work, too! Illegal body-checking and
free use of their sticks!... Yes, sir—there’s
the referee waving them off the ice ... a major
penalty for both of ’em!”</p>

<p class='c007' >A chorus of boohs followed the two Howard
defense men as they skated to the sideboards
and clambered into the penalty box to remain
out of the game for five minutes which, in this
case, meant that the contest would be over before
they could return.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Hello—Carl’s hurt!” discovered the crowd,
as the huddled figure sprawled near the sideboards,
failed to rise. “He took quite a wallop!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Knocked unconscious by the impact and
suffering a jolting bump on his head, Taber’s
hockey star was carried off the ice to the dressing
room as the crowd gave him a burst of sympathetic
applause. Minus two of her players,
Howard Prep’s scoring possibilities were so reduced
that she was forced to go strictly on the
defensive save for lone attempts to put the puck
in from long range. Taber High won the game
a few minutes later, three goals to one—the injured
Carl’s two goals again providing the margin
of victory.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Wonder how Carl is?” was Lank Broderick’s
first question, as the teams left the ice.
“I’d like to take a punch at those two Howard
guys. Sorry they didn’t get back in play!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Lank was Carl’s team-mate at left wing, Carl
serving as forward on the right wing. They
thought much of each other, Lank sacrificing
his chances of scoring to feed the puck
to Carl because of Carl’s admittedly greater
prowess.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m not interested in who makes the scores,
just so they’re made,” Lank had often said.
“Besides, I’ve got sense enough to know that
we’d have just an ordinary hockey team if it
wasn’t for Carl ... and we’d be foolish if
we didn’t build our six around him ... since
he can do so much for us!”</p>

<p class='c007' >In the locker room, stretched out on a rubbing
table, fellow team-mates found their idol,
Carl. Taber High’s right wing had just regained
consciousness and was staring dazedly
at the ceiling. He raised up on his elbows and
reached out his hand for an imaginary stick.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Game’s over!” said Doctor Lawrence, pushing
Carl gently back.</p>

<p class='c007' >“And we won!” informed Lank, stepping to
Carl’s side.</p>

<p class='c007' >The injured star nodded and moistened his
lips, still staring.</p>

<p class='c007' >“How did I get in here?” he asked, and put
a shaky hand to his head. “The last I remember
I—I was going through...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Lank grinned, reassuringly. “Yes, but they
gave you the works, Carl, old boy ... and you
did a backward flip-flop, landing on your bean.
That was ‘lights’ for you.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“It—it must have been,” said Carl, faintly.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m glad it wasn’t a knee or an ankle,”
kidded Lank. “Only your head!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“<em>Only?</em>” repeated Carl, too stunned to react
to kidding.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I mean—you’ll soon be over this bump.
We’ll sure need you week after next when we
run into Siddall. You’ll have a chance to give
your one rival some real competition then,”
Lank went on.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Whiz Deagen?” spoke Carl, and bit his lips.
“Gee—my head! If you don’t mind ... I
don’t want to talk hockey now ... I want to
get home.... Where’s my clothes?... I
want to get home...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’ll get you home all right,” declared
Doctor Lawrence. “Just take it easy.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Motioning to Taber High’s team-members
to ‘clear out’, Doctor saw to it that Carl Hemmer
was dressed and sent home in a car. Then,
returning to the locker room he called the squad
together and said: “Carl’s suffered a slight concussion.
Nothing serious but he’ll feel the
shock for several days. Better if he doesn’t talk
or think hockey. I suggest you let him alone.
A fellow usually reacts against an unpleasant
experience. A few days’ rest and his old zest
for the game will return naturally. Say nothing
about this ... and when you see him ...
act just as though nothing has happened. Get
me?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Yea, Doc!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Okay—that’s all!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Historic was the only word to describe the
battles between Siddall and Taber, rivals of
long standing. It was generally acknowledged
that these two high schools turned out the best
ice hockey teams in the country ... best of
their class, that is. “We thirst for each other’s
blood,” was the way a Siddall rooter expressed
it, putting on what he described as a “bloodthirsty”
expression. This season both sextets
looked forward to their clash with more than
ordinary interest because each possessed a hockey
player of outstanding ability. Whiz Deagen
had been to Siddall what Carl Hemmer had
been to Taber and this was the highest compliment
that could be paid—practically signalizing
that he was all but the whole team.</p>

<p class='c007' >“When those two boys clash it will be worth
coming miles to see,” a Taber supporter had declared.</p>

<p class='c007' >Concern, however, was now secretly expressed
as to the possible extent of injuries Carl
Hemmer may have suffered. Had Doctor
Lawrence withheld any vital information?
The fact that Carl was being kept in bed two
days after the game did not sound so good.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Say, if Carl’s out of that game, we might
as well forfeit!” commented a sports authority.
“Whiz will skate the rest of our team dizzy!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Great was the relief when, two days before
the Winston game, Carl Hemmer showed up
at the locker room, ready to don his togs.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I feel fine,” he announced, quietly.</p>

<p class='c007' >“That’s great!” greeted Lank, cordially.
“Glad to have you back!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Coach Corcoran conferred with Doctor Lawrence.
The Winston game was not expected to
tax Taber seriously.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Better not scrimmage him yet,” was Doctor’s
advice. “I doubt if the team needs another
scrimmage session. Just a running through
their formations.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I think you’re right,” said the Coach.</p>

<p class='c007' >In practice the presence of Carl Hemmer
brought back the old snap in the team. The
puck skimmed from player to player as they
swept up and down the ice in formation.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I want to see these plays click in the Winston
game,” called Coach Corcoran. “It’ll be our
last chance to brush up on ’em before we hit
Siddall!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“They’ll look like a million!” promised
Lank.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007' >Thirty cents is as far from a million as the
earth is from the moon. That Lank’s enthusiastic
prophecy was not fulfilled was due not
so much to Winston as to the fellow who had
been Taber High’s spark plug. Since most of
the plays were built around him, Carl Hemmer
absolutely had to be functioning himself if the
formations were to be successfully completed.
But the game was not five minutes old before
players and spectators alike knew that something
was radically wrong with the usually dependable
and scintillating right wing. Carl started
his dashes with the usual fervor but they faded
rapidly as he passed center ice and, instead of
going through at all costs, he veered to right or
left, attempting to evade the Winston defense
and slipping into the end zone along the sideboards.
His efforts, as a result, were reduced
almost to naught with the puck being lost repeatedly
and Winston’s starting an offensive of
its own.</p>

<p class='c007' >“This sometimes happens to a fellow who
gets a bad bump on the head,” remarked Doctor
Lawrence privately to an anxious Coach Corcoran.
“That’s why I wanted Carl to take
things so easy. It’s just as though he’d been
beaned by a baseball. He has a nervous reaction
to thoughts of another possible crash. But it’ll
wear off!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“That may be,” conceded the Coach. “But
when? That’s the question!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“He should get better before this game is
over,” said the Doctor.</p>

<p class='c007' >But Carl Hemmer’s improvement was not
noticeable. And the falling off in his playing
form was making what should have been an
easy game look hard. As late as the third quarter,
Taber High was leading by only one goal to
none, and this goal scored by Lank who’d
smacked in the rebound of a long shot which
Carl had fired from the blue line.</p>

<p class='c007' >“What’s the matter, Carl, old warhorse?”
Lank finally asked, as team members looked
on, wonderingly.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Nothing!” was Carl’s tight-lipped answer.</p>

<p class='c007' >And no one had the heart to question him
further.</p>

<p class='c007' >The game ended without a change in the
score and sports writers now had something to
write about. “Injury Affects Hemmer’s Playing,”
one heading said. “Hemmer Shadow of
Former Self,” declared another. “Crippling
of Hemmer Menaces Chances Against Siddall,”
was a third feature title. But it remained for
one sport scribe to offer the explanation that
“Hemmer played under wraps, apparently by
instructions of Coach Corcoran who was running
no risks against his not being in shape to
meet Siddall next Saturday. There’s little
doubt but that Carl will be in his customary
great form at that time ... and then we’ll be
treated to a whirlwind battle between himself
and Whiz Deagen—two of the smartest performers
in high school hockey.”</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007' >Rated as two evenly matched sextets, Taber
and Siddall High Schools drew a capacity crowd
at the Taber rink to witness what had been
heralded as probably their most spirited encounter.
Both rooting sections buzzed with
excitement as their respective teams skated on
the ice. This excitement reached high tension
when Whiz Deagen and Carl Hemmer met up
with each other and shook hands near the Siddall
bench.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Hey, Carl,” called a wit, “which one of
you’s the better player?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“We don’t know yet,” Taber’s great star
grinned in reply.</p>

<p class='c007' >“But it won’t be long now,” added Whiz,
showing a nice set of teeth.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Those two could cut each other’s throats,”
the bloodthirsty fan confided to the rooter next
to him. “They’re just letting on that they’re
friends. Wait till you see what they do to each
other in a game!”</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007' >Slashing sticks, racing forms, skidding slides,
bruising falls—all in the pursuit of a mad-traveling
puck! The first period of the Taber-Siddall
battle was replete with thrills, both
teams putting up a frenzied defense, breaking
up formations by stiff body-checking and clever
poke-checking with their sticks. The puck
changed hands in mid-ice with bewildering
rapidity as the main fight centered between the
blue lines. Long shots were taken when it was
found almost impossible to crash through the
human defense walls. During this hectic
period even Whiz Deagen and Carl Hemmer
were swallowed up in swirling action.
Occasionally they would get free and the crowd
would roar in anticipation of a spectacular dash
but their chances didn’t materialize. They were
set upon before going far and forced to retreat
or surrender the puck.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Whiz and Carl are killing each other off!”
opined one rooter as the period ended, nothing
to nothing. “They’re so afraid one or the other
is going to break loose that they’re spending
their time on each other’s necks! However, the
game is young yet!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Siddall started the second period with a rush.
Having sounded out Taber’s system of play the
first fifteen minutes, the enemy—led by their
redoubtable Whiz Deagen—assailed the Taber
net. This time they broke through Taber’s defense
for close-in shots and goalie Frank Cary
had a man-sized job on his hands warding the
fast-flying puck off with stick, pads, gloves,
body and head. He elicited cheer after cheer
for his marvelous goal-guarding but Siddall’s
persistent battering was not to be denied. Whiz
Deagen, capturing the puck in mid-ice, whirled
and feinted a pass, then zig-zagged past Taber’s
two defense men who made desperate attempts
to stop him. He rode on his skate runners up
to the very mouth of the cage and shoved the
puck, lightning fast, past goalie Cary who,
even then, threw himself prone in the wild hope
of averting a score.</p>

<p class='c007' >“No soap!” grinned Whiz, fishing the puck
out of the net as the referee’s whistle screeched
and the red light of the official score blinked on.
“You’re licked. It’s just a question of how
much!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’ll get that goal back!” rejoined goalie
Cary. “You’ll see!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Whiz Deagen laughed. He was still laughing
at the next face-off when the man whom
Taber fans had picked to outshine him, got his
stick on the puck and started on a lone dash.
These kind of dashes were what had made him
famous and Siddall who had worked out a
special defense against them, massed for the
attack. To the consternation of all, however,
Carl did not meet the challenge but veered
sharply at the last moment and tried to get past
without bodily conflict.</p>

<p class='c007' >“That’s bad,” said Doctor Lawrence who sat
beside Coach Corcoran on the bench. “It’s still
got him!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Whiz Deagen, following Carl closely, caught
him as he slackened his pace, crossed sticks
with him and scraped the puck away as both
brought up against the sideboards with a crash,
Carl pulling back instinctively to lessen the
impact.</p>

<p class='c007' >“What’s eating you?” fired Lank, skating up
as Whiz was off with the puck.</p>

<p class='c007' >Carl’s usual self-confident manner was gone.
His face looked drawn. He was actually
trembling. There was no time to question him
then with Siddall once more threatening Taber’s
goal and goalie Frank Carey doing another
magnificent job of standing the invaders off. A
mix-up in front of the cage brought a face-off
and once again Carl had the puck. Once again
his brilliant skating took him out of the pack on
a solo dash which swept past mid-rink and beyond
the blue line into Siddall’s end zone. Once
again, however, with the crowd screaming
wildly, expecting a characteristic Carl Hemmer
drive through the enemy’s defense, Taber’s
right wing swerved to avoid a collision. In
doing so he lost his balance and the puck was
jostled from the crook of his stick, all his effort
going for naught.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Booh!” shouted an over-zealous fan, but
the razz died in his throat as the crowd hushed
him.</p>

<p class='c007' >Chagrined beyond words, Carl skated madly
back into play, now chasing the Siddall men
with the puck and trying to wrest it from them.
Taber’s idol was a hollow husk of himself and
Siddall now knew it for a certainty. Whiz
Deagen even took to taunting him by slapping
the puck his way, confident that Taber’s crack
player couldn’t get past Siddall’s blue line.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I dare you!” he shouted, and a fellow whose
face was almost as blue as the line in the ice
marking the zones, couldn’t bring himself to
accept the challenge.</p>

<p class='c007' >At the end of the second period the score
was—Siddall, 1; Taber, 0.</p>

<p class='c007' >In the locker room perturbed team-mates
gathered about Carl to inquire the cause of his
poor play. Carl could only answer them with
a hopeless shake of the head. But Lank Broderick,
more sympathetic, took him by the arm
and led him to one side.</p>

<p class='c007' >“What is it, Carl? Tell me!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Taber’s right wing, always the bulwark of
the team before, now clutched his running
mate’s arm, piteously.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Lank, I can’t explain it. All I know is ...
I can’t make myself go through any more. I
think I can when I start out ... but when I’m
right there ... I lose my nerve or something!...
It’s the most terrible feeling....
It feels like I’m just about to skate into <em>blackness</em>...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Lank, watching Carl closely, nodded understandingly.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Listen, Lank,” begged Carl, tremulously.
“We’ve got to win this game. I used to break
the defense and get through to take passes from
you and shoot the goals. Can’t we reverse
things?... <em>You</em> go through and I’ll pass to
<em>you</em>!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Lank hesitated. “I can try,” he promised.
“It’s not so easy to get through that bunch. I
don’t have your form, you know. You had a
system all your own...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m sorry,” Carl said. “I feel like a rotter.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“You’ll snap into it,” Lank encouraged.
“Come on—let’s go!”</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007' >Siddall skated out for the third and last period
a cocky sextet headed by a carefree Whiz
Deagen. True, the visitors were only leading
by one goal but their defense had been impregnable
and they had stopped the mighty Carl
Hemmer cold even as Winston, a much lesser
team, had done the week before. There was no
reason why they could not add to their score or,
failing in this, hold a stubbornly defensive
Taber to no goals.</p>

<p class='c007' >Lank Broderick, Taber’s left wing, true to
his word, tried to crack Siddall’s defense but was
repulsed. He tried again and again, being body-checked
out of play. The crowd seemed to
sense that he was attempting to make up in a
measure for Carl’s strange loss of form and he
was cheered each time he took the puck.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Get going, Carl!” the fans yelled, to no
avail.</p>

<p class='c007' >The much-heralded combat between Whiz
Deagen and Carl Hemmer was proving a washout.
Whiz was having things much his own way
and would probably be credited with winning
the game—most certainly should his one goal
be the margin of victory.</p>

<p class='c007' >With eight minutes left to play, Lank skated
close to Carl.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Next time I get the puck,” he said in his
ear, “I’m going to crash that defense or know
the reason why. You follow right behind me
and when I make the hole, you slip through.
Watch for the puck because I’ll flip it back to
you just as I smack into them!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I got you!” Carl replied. “I’ll be there!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Lank’s opportunity came two minutes later.
Carl cut across the ice to join him as Lank
started down the ice. He was trailing as Lank
skimmed past the blue line and prepared for a
body-crashing contact with Siddall’s two defense
men. The puck came back to him on a perfect
back-handed pass. Lank, having gotten up
more momentum than ever before, hit the two
defense men with great force ... so much
so that all were knocked off their feet. Carl,
going fast himself, had to tap the puck to one
side and leap their bodies to avoid entanglement.
He captured the puck, with the rink a bedlam of
sound, and headed for the Siddall net with the
goalie crouched in its mouth, broad-bladed stick
across his knees.</p>

<p class='c007' >“There she is!” screamed Taber rooters, going
mad as Carl’s close-up shot sent the puck
hurtling into the net for the goal which tied
the score. “Carl looked like his old self on
that one, eh?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Sure—after Lank made the way for him!”
agreed an observer. “And look at Lank now—he’s
stretched out on the ice as cold as a Thanksgiving
turkey!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Cheers died to a breathless silence as Coach
Corcoran and Doctor Lawrence hurried on the
ice. Taber’s left forward stirred and raised partially
up, then writhed in pain.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Sprained knee,” was the verdict after he had
been examined. “Breath knocked out, too ...
and a nice little bump on the head!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Carl’s elation at his having scored was shortlived
at seeing that the fellow who had made his
score possible was ‘out’ on the play. He reached
Lank’s side as Lank was lifted up.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Good work, Carl!” Lank complimented.
“I knew—if I could get you through
there...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Carl winced. “It’s all my fault,” he
blamed. “You were doing what <em>I</em> should have
done. I scored on <em>your nerve</em>!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“You’re welcome to it,” proffered Lank, as
they carried him toward the sidelines, Carl
skating alongside. “Nerve is such a little thing
compared to a fellow who can play hockey like
you can!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Taber’s crack hockey player swallowed. A
flash came in his eyes. Turning to fellow team
members he cried: “Get me that puck, you
guys! That’s all you’ve got to do!... I’ll
take it down the ice!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Whiz Deagen, noting his rival’s change of
attitude, turned to his team-mates. “I’ll handle
this baby!” he assured.</p>

<p class='c007' >With the next facing off of the puck at center
ice, an electric thrill passed through the crowd
as the long-anticipated clash between the two
great hockey stars arrived! It was now anybody’s
game and very likely that the next goal
would decide the victor. Whiz, catching the
puck on his stick as it slid along the ice on a pass
from Siddall’s center, started a dodging, twisting
drive into Taber territory. Carl Hemmer,
however, was on his heels, dogging every stride
of his journey. The two swooped together in
front of Taber’s cage and went down in a heap
as the puck upended and rolled to the sideboards.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Carl prevented a sure score then!” cried a
spectator.</p>

<p class='c007' >Both stars were up in an instant and giving
pursuit as team-mates dived in. And now it
was Carl who stick-handled the puck out of
the mêlée and broke away for a dash, with Whiz
frenziedly bringing up the rear.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Atta boy, Carl! <em>Down the ice!</em>” shouted
a familiar voice from the sidelines.</p>

<p class='c007' >Taber High’s great star passed the Taber
bench at mid-ice and heard Lank’s shrill yell
as he flashed by. A grim Siddall defense formed
to meet him. This time every one in the crowd
knew that there would be no flinching ...
that Carl was once again the Carl of old ...
that he would crash through if it was humanly
possible.</p>

<p class='c007' >Smack! The collision between opposing
forces and one lone, speeding figure was violent.
All went down in a struggling heap and
the puck skidded clear. Carl’s dash had been
broken up ... and Whiz Deagen, who had
trailed him fiendishly, was now in possession of
the puck, spinning around toward the Taber net
with Taber’s defense thrown out of position!</p>

<p class='c007' >“Stop him, somebody!” screamed Taber.</p>

<p class='c007' >Bobbing to his feet as he slid across the ice
after being joltingly bumped, Carl Hemmer
put on an amazing burst of speed in an effort to
overtake the fast-traveling Whiz Deagen.
Siddall’s hockey star evaded Taber defense men
as they rushed across the ice in an attempt to cut
off his path to the goal. An instant later he
was driving in on goalie Frank Carey who
looked particularly helpless in the face of this
inspired advance. Fifteen feet behind Whiz,
and eating up distance with every frantic stroke,
was Carl ... but too late to prevent Whiz’s
shot. The crowd shrieked its excitement as
goalie Carey made a phenomenal stop of a
vicious drive—blocking the puck with his
chest. The stop, however, pulled him from the
mouth of the cage, leaving it totally unprotected
as the puck bounded directly in front with
Whiz leaping in to take the rebound and finish
his job. But, just as his stick was about to make
contact with the puck, a figure slid swiftly
across the ice and swept the puck to the side.
Whiz tripped and fell on Carl and was carried
along with him. A terrific mix-up followed
with everyone but the goalies involved as the
rink became a maelstrom of heart-palpitating,
eye-bewildering action.</p>

<p class='c007' >A minute of play was left as Carl Hemmer,
who had suddenly become as a madman on the
loose, emerged from a tangle near the
sideboards, the puck riding smoothly ahead of his
stick. This time the mighty Whiz Deagen was
in front of him at center ice, and behind Deagen
were Siddall’s two defense men, in position.</p>

<p class='c007' >“He’ll never get through that pack!” murmured
a Taber fan, nervously. “This looks like
an overtime tie game!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Whiz, preparing to dodge whichever direction
Carl might dodge, crouched with stick
across his knees. The two stars had managed
to reduce each other’s brilliant efforts practically
to naught thus far.</p>

<p class='c007' >Approaching his rival at top speed, Carl suddenly
turned his skates sidewise and sent up a
shower of ice. He veered to the left, then reversed
his direction, shot the puck ahead and
followed it like a demon. Whiz, lunging to
his right, was unprepared for a double shift and
a great cry rang out as Carl, outmaneuvering his
rival drove on into Siddall’s defense. He was
crouching low as the defense men sought to
body-check him. There was a resounding impact
and both defense men left their feet, bumping
jarringly to ice. Carl, brought to his knees,
the puck jolted from his stick ahead of him,
slid after it toward Siddall’s goal where a
wide-eyed goalie braced himself for the onslaught.</p>

<p class='c007' >“It’s a loose puck!” cried someone. “The
goalie’s going to bat it out!”</p>

<p class='c007' >It seemed the only thing to do ... leaving
his cage for the moment since no defense men
could reach the scene in time to be of help. The
Siddall goalie advanced several feet in front of
the cage, jabbing out his stick. As he did so,
Carl, still sliding in a half-sitting position,
hooked out his stick and contacted the puck.
The goalie swung at the black object but his
stick landed atop Carl’s and bounced off.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Shoot!” begged Lank, from the bench.</p>

<p class='c007' >And Taber’s hockey star, without having
time to regain his feet, skidding in close to the
goal, punched the puck ahead of him with a
sidearm swing, almost under the very feet of a
goalie now out of position. The puck turned
on edge and rolled into the cage where it snuggled
in a corner of the net. The scorer’s red
light blazed almost simultaneous with the blazing
of the timer’s gun.</p>

<p class='c007' >“It’s all over!” yelled elated Taber supporters.
“What a play!”</p>

<p class='c007' >It took a moment after that for Taber fans to
appreciate that their hockey team had
completed an undefeated season ... and that one
great hockey star had demonstrated his superiority
over another star, almost equally great.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Awfully sorry you had to get hurt on account
of me!” a contrite Carl Hemmer was
apologizing the next moment as he clasped
Lank’s hand.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m okay now!” grinned Lank, in open admiration.
“Boy, the bump I took was worth it
to see you stand Siddall on their heads!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I felt that bump myself,” said Carl,
pointedly, as Taber rooters gathered hilariously
about to cheer their hockey idol whose star was
once more high in the heavens. “I felt it,” continued
Carl a bit huskily, “thanks to you—right
where I needed it most!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='story2' class='c009'>THE ICE CYCLONE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006' >“You can’t play hockey and you never could!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Is that so?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Yes, that’s so. You’re just a fancy skater
but your figure eights don’t do you any good in
a game.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Rand Downey, right wing on the Kirkwood
High six, was boiling mad. This fellow, Frederick,
the <em>Great</em>, Barker, had finally gotten so on
his nerves as to cause him to explode. The idea
of Coach Howard putting this impossible person
on the team at left wing, replacing the veteran
Don Keith who was out with a sprained ankle!
What did Coach want to do—throw the whole
team off its stride and right before the big game
with Melville?</p>

<p class='c007' >“It’s true I haven’t played much hockey,”
the slenderly built Frederick was replying.
“You must remember, old boy, I didn’t come
out for the team—I was ... er ... pressed
into service when the ... er ... expediency arose.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Frederick was like that. Big words, stilted
sentences, haughty, superior manner. He didn’t
have a close friend in the school; kept pretty
much to himself; played a lone hand when it
came to sports. Track and ice skating had
seemed to be his two favorite athletic diversions.
In his peculiarly aloof way he had
stepped out and won the two-twenty and four-forty,
setting county records for both events.
On the ice, Frederick had exhibited a brand of
fancy skating which had astounded the natives.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I should be able to skate,” he had said, after
winning the cup with ease. “My folks spent
a couple years in Canada and, you know, babies
are born with skates on their feet up there.”</p>

<p class='c007' >It had been Coach Howard’s idea that the
conversion of Frederick, the Great, Barker into
a hockey player, would add amazing strength to
the team. Strangely enough, the newcomer to
Kirkwood had not been enthusiastic about the
thoughts of playing.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Ice skating is a game of grace and beauty of
movement,” had been his explanation. “I just
don’t see anything to this rough and tumble
business.”</p>

<p class='c007' >But the old appeal “for the honor and glory
of the school” had won Frederick over. He
had readily agreed to Coach Howard’s declaration
that Kirkwood High possessed few really
good skaters although he was not so sure that his
addition to the team would have the bolstering
effect predicted.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ll do the best I can,” had been his promise.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You’ll be a whiz,” the coach had encouraged.
“A man as fast on his feet as you? Why,
say—when you get this hockey game in your
blood, you’ll burn up the ice!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Thus far, however, Frederick’s participation
had only succeeded in burning up his fellow
players. Rand Downey, who had to play opposite
him on the other wing, had reasons to
be the most upset.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’d like to ask,” flared Rand, “how’s it come
you’ve always picked soft sports to excel in?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“What do you mean—‘soft’?” Frederick’s
expression was one of hurt surprise.</p>

<p class='c007' >“No physical conflict ... no bumping up
against a real opponent ... like in football or
baseball or—<em>hockey</em>?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Competition of that sort doesn’t interest
me,” stated Frederick frankly, a flush creeping
into his cheeks.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You mean,” taunted Rand, bent on driving
home his thrust, “that you’d rather not mix it
with anybody ... you’re afraid of getting
your hair mussed or a punch in the eye or your
nose rubbed in the dirt.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Fellow players glared at their new team
member, obviously in support of Rand’s accusation.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I admit,” answered Frederick, unblinkingly,
“such things do not appeal to me.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The fellow’s absolute candor was amazing.
Rand had deliberately set out to antagonize him
and here he was, quietly agreeing to everything.
Apparently Frederick, who came by his title
“the Great” through this air of superiority,
could not be fussed nor aroused. He made no
pretense of that which he was not and indicated
quite plainly that he felt entitled to his
views on sport.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I suppose you know, then,” fired Rand, as
a last broadside, “that you play hockey like a
lady!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Worse than that!” broke in Steve Lucas,
captain and center. “It would be different,
Fred, if you weren’t such a good skater ... but
there’s no excuse for the way you’re side-stepping
and skating in circles and dropping
the puck at the blue line instead of trying to go
through the defense. There’s a certain color
that applies to guys who pull what you’ve been
pulling. We wouldn’t care only we’d give our
skates to beat Melville this year.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“And a fat chance we’ve got with Don Keith
out,” ranted Bill Stewart, stocky right defense.
“He was the spark plug of our team. All
you’ve done is fill us up with carbon!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m sorry,” was the new team member’s
comment as he unfastened his skates and stepped
off the rink. “But why jump me about this?
I suggest you take your story to the coach. Any
time he wants me to leave the team, I’ll be delighted.”</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007' >Fellow players groaned helplessly as
Frederick, the Great, Barker walked off, head
high.</p>

<p class='c007' >“He’s a conundrum, that bird!” declared
Rand. “You’d think he didn’t have any fight
in him.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“He doesn’t when it comes to sports like
this,” said Bill. “You hit the nail on the head
when you razzed him about not wanting to
mix it. I can understand now why he’s steered
clear of us fellows. He’s against anything
boisterous.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“He’s grooming himself to be one of those
gentleman sportsmen,” twitted Steve, “whose
pictures you see in the rotogravure section of
newspapers, sitting on a horse, dressed in a polo
cap; or else stretched out on a country club
veranda, in golf togs. The pictures look swell
but most of ’em don’t mean any thing.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“He’s a grand guy,” summed up Rand. “I
have to hand it to him for one thing. He’s sure
satisfied with himself. If I’d bawled any of
you birds out the way I did him, I’d have started
a free-for-all. He’s got the spunk of a caterpillar.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Coach certainly won’t leave him in the line-up
after today’s game,” reassured goal tender
Chub Roland. “We were lucky not to lose.
Fred spent about the whole time dodging collisions
with the enemy. I think he only went
down once. He’s a fancy skater all right. He
did some of the fanciest shifting I ever saw.
Never used his body to block once ... tried to
do it all with his stick. I yelled to him once
to get in front of his man but he acted like
he thought it wouldn’t be the gentlemanly thing
to do. Too bad he has to be such a lemon. I
still think if we could get him steamed up about
something—he might surprise us.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Not that baby!” scoffed Rand. “He’s got
chronic cold feet. You’ll never see him make a
showing where he’s got to swap bumps with
someone else. He says himself that’s not his
idea of sport. Personally, I wouldn’t get any
kick out of running races or making fancy doodads
on the ice. I’d just as soon take up crocheting.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The Kirkwood ice hockey squad laughed.
It had been a hard, tense season with little opportunity
to relax against an unusually high
brand of competition. That Kirkwood had
managed to remain a contender for the state
interscholastic ice hockey championship, despite
the absence of dependable spares, had been due
to the heroic effort of the original six and the
excellent guidance of Coach Howard. His
latest move, however, in recruiting Frederick,
the Great, as a hockey player, had appeared a
psychological mistake, affecting as it had, the
team’s morale. Even sporting accounts of the
game were none too complimentary.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Fred Barker, playing his third game at left
wing for Kirkwood,” said the <em>Daily Eagle</em>,
“still left much to be desired. Making
allowance for the fact that ice hockey is
new to the champion fancy skater, Barker,
in the judgment of this sports writer, should
be entering more into the spirit of the
game and teaming up better with his mates.
Time and again, on capturing the puck, he
seemed at a loss as to what to do with it,
taking some pretty turns about the ice which
promised much but produced nothing. Coach
Howard still seems of the opinion that Barker
is going to fill Don Keith’s skating shoes but,
on the basis of his performance today, he will
have to come along rapidly to even approach
Don’s stellar ability. Keith-to-Downey-to-Keith
used to be the pass combination which
brought scores for Kirkwood. Either that or
the reverse: Downey-to-Keith-to-Downey with
the resultant shot for goal. But Kirkwood has
lost her scoring punch, temporarily at least—a
punch she sorely needs in the coming battle
against Melville, a sextet possessing such defensive
power that not a goal has been scored
against her the entire season!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I suppose you read the papers,” was Coach
Howard’s greeting to Frederick, the Great,
Barker on calling him aside at the next practice
session.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Yes, sir,” Frederick replied, in a disinterested tone.</p>

<p class='c007' >“That being the case, it saves me breath,”
said the coach. “The accounts of your playing
were fairly accurate.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I thought so myself,” agreed Frederick.</p>

<p class='c007' >“But you can do better than this. Why, man—you
haven’t begun to let yourself out yet!
I’ve seen your fancy skating exhibitions and I
know what you can do—your daring leaps and
whirls. That airplane dive, as you call it, is
one of the most hairbreadth things I’ve ever
seen on skates.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Frederick’s face spread into a slow smile.</p>

<p class='c007' >“That isn’t bad, is it?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Bad? It’s simply great. But why can’t you
transmit a bit of that dash into hockey? You’re
doing some nice straight skating but that reckless
abandon isn’t there. I believe in you, Fred,
or I wouldn’t have urged you to play, against
your own inclination.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The champion fancy skater dug the point
of his skate into the ice.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I know that,” he said, with his first show
of feeling, “but I can’t help it, coach—I’m doing
the best I can.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Coach Howard eyed the new left wing
shrewdly.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You’re just kidding yourself, Fred,” he
said, pointedly. “There’s something troubling
you, boy. It’s been troubling you for a long,
long while and it’s time you were getting it off
your chest. Come clean—what is it?”</p>

<p class='c007' >A hurt expression came into Frederick’s face
which he ordinarily kept well masked beneath
the external attitude of indifference.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You wouldn’t understand if I told you,”
he returned, huskily.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Perhaps I would.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“How could you when I don’t really understand
myself? All I know is that I’ve never
had a desire for direct competitive sport. It
dates back to the days when I was sickly and my
parents discouraged me from taking part in the
games and bucking up against the stronger fellows.
I was disappointed, of course, and it sort
of killed something inside me.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“You can get it back,” reassured Coach
Howard. “Give yourself a chance.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Frederick shook his head, sorrowfully.
“Since I couldn’t go in for the sports other fellows
were playing, I developed the habit of
staying off by myself. That hasn’t helped me,
either. I guess I’ve been too retrospective.
There’s such a word, isn’t there?”</p>

<p class='c007' >The coach smiled, sympathetically. “I think
so—but I’ve been so busy with my present that
I haven’t had time to look backward. You
shouldn’t let the past have such a hold on you,
Fred—snap out of this! You’re missing half
the fun in sport!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Frederick nodded, ruefully. “I’d give a lot
to be able to get enthused,” he confessed.
“When I see the kick the other fellows get out
of playing, I know something must be wrong
with me. All my athletic development has
been individual and team play has left me cold.
You want to know what hockey seems like to
me? It’s just a series of cracked heads and shins
and so many knockdowns.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Coach Howard laughed. “It’s because you
haven’t thrown yourself into the game ...
haven’t caught the spirit of it,” he insisted.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I guess I haven’t,” Frederick conceded.
“As an individualist, I’m impressed with the
fact that, in hockey, skating is secondary to the
game and I get no particular thrill out of chasing
a puck and banging at it with a stick.
Neither can I see any necessity for letting myself
be bumped to the ice if I can possibly help
it. For that reason, some of the fellows are
insinuating that I’m yellow. I hope you don’t
think that?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Frankly,” said Coach Howard, “you’re one
fellow I can’t catalogue. You’ve got me
astraddle a fence.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Well, I feel better for talking with you,”
said the champion fancy skater. “I’ve never
opened up like this before. No one’s seemed
to care....”</p>

<p class='c007' >“No one’s cared because you haven’t seemed
to care what they were doing,” explained the
coach. “They won’t warm up to you until you
warm up to them—that’s only natural.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Frederick swallowed, miserably. “Then I
really don’t know what I can do about it,” he
said, hoarsely. “I’m so used to doing things by
myself that I don’t feel at home with other
fellows. I guess you’d better call it ‘quits’,
Coach. I wouldn’t want to lose the Melville
game for you ... almost anyone would be better
in there than me ... no matter how good a
skater I am....”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Nonsense!” decided Coach Howard. “This
game means the championship—but if it meant
a chance for you to win out over yourself, I’d
rather play for that. You’re going to discover
one of these times, Fred, that you need hockey
much more than hockey needs you and when you
do—well, you’ll be a different fellow!”</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007' >All of Kirkwood sat on the anxious seat the
day of the Melville game. It was biting cold
and clear and the rink was in the fastest condition
of the season. There could be no complaint
of the day or of the ice. The only cause
for concern was the Kirkwood team which had
played uncertain hockey since the loss of Don
Keith. But Coach Howard had been keeping
a surprise up his sleeve for the fans. Don’s
sprained ankle was well enough for him to play
a part of the game, properly taped. When he
reported for duty before the contest and told his
overjoyed comrades that he had been working
out secretly for the past three days, the old
morale returned. The feeling of apprehension
over Frederick, the Great, Barker vanished at
once; in fact, Kirkwood’s new left wing was
left completely out of the demonstration, sitting
quietly on a bench in the corner of the locker
room.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m glad to see you back, Keith,” he welcomed,
when Kirkwood’s veteran, limping
slightly, came back to his locker.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Glad to be back,” Keith rejoined, eyes
gleaming. “We’ve got to take that chesty outfit
today. Can you imagine their not even being
scored on all year? Have to watch out for their
crack centre, Scotty Lathrom. He’s the backbone
of their offense and defense ... one of
the best poke-checkers in the game!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’ll lay for him all right,” promised right
wing Rand Downey. “Boy, it seems like old
times again. We’ve got the winning combination
now!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Frederick, marveling at the revival of spirit,
studied the fellow who was responsible for it.
Don Keith possessed, in addition to a sturdy
physique, a radiant, aggressive personality. He
commanded attention and inspired others to follow
his leadership. Noting this, Frederick envied
Don Keith sincerely.</p>

<p class='c007' >“If you can’t feel a thing,” he said to
himself, consolingly, “you can’t be a part of it.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Coach Howard, as the team left the locker
room for the rink, patted Frederick on the back.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ll be using you to relieve Don,” he informed.
“So be ready to go in there and tear
loose!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Frederick smiled, ironically. He knew he’d
be regarded as doing his bit today if he merely
helped hold the fort until Don should get his
“breathers” and go charging back into the fray.
Perhaps it was just as well. He’d only consented
to play hockey as a duty to the school and, this
way, whatever the outcome of the game, no one
could hold him directly responsible.</p>

<p class='c007' >Don Keith received a tremendous ovation
from home town supporters as he skated on the
ice. Frederick joined the secondary forward
wall and practiced pass work. The Melville
team flashed by, a rugged looking outfit.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Where’s this Frederick, the Great, person?”
a voice suddenly shrilled.</p>

<p class='c007' >Frederick looked about, surprised, and found
himself confronted by Melville’s grinning star,
Scotty Lathrom.</p>

<p class='c007' >“So you’re the champion fancy skater, eh?”
Scotty accosted, in a loud voice which attracted
the attention of the crowd. “Well, I’ve been
waiting to meet you, brother, because I’ve
worked out a few gyrations I’d like to see you
duplicate!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Frederick stared at his unexpected challenger,
coldly. What was this Scotty Lathrom
trying to do—get his goat—or make him look
foolish before the fans?</p>

<p class='c007' >“If you thought you were so good,” he replied,
quietly, “why didn’t you enter the fancy
skating competition?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m going to next year,” announced Scotty.
“And I’m going to pull some stuff they never
saw before. Look at this one!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Melville’s crack hockey player spun about
on the sides of his skates and went into a roll.</p>

<p class='c007' >“That’s easy,” said Frederick, and followed
suit, reproducing the roll with an even more
polished finish.</p>

<p class='c007' >“But that’s not all of it!” Scotty called, and
rolled to the side, doing a surprise handspring,
picking up the roll again, then going into another
handspring, alternating from side to side
and with a cadence that was pretty to watch.
“There you are!” he cried, as the crowd applauded.</p>

<p class='c007' >Frederick felt the competitive urge well up
within him. He forgot for the moment that
this meeting between Kirkwood and Melville
was essentially for the playing of hockey. Here
was an individual who dared meeting him on
his own ground—who defied the ice skating
champion! The stunt that Scotty had pulled
was a new variation, one in which Frederick
was not practiced, but the crowd had begun
yelling for him to repeat the trick as Scotty
stood by, banteringly.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I guess that stumps you, doesn’t it?” taunted
Melville’s crack centre.</p>

<p class='c007' >Rand Downey, with other members of Kirkwood’s
team, watched the developments with
great interest and no little amusement.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Frederick, the Great’s in a hotbox now,”
chuckled Rand. “If he refuses to try to duplicate
Scotty’s stunt, he admits he’s licked; and
if he tries it and flops, he’s just as bad off!
Serves the old boy right. Scotty’s hitting him
in the only place where he can be hurt!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Deadly serious and grimly determined, Frederick
skated off across the ice, whirled and came
back in a series of rolls. Twice it seemed as
though he was about to go into a handspring
but checked himself and continued on. It was
obvious that the maneuver was a new one to
him and that he was feeling his way before
actually attempting the stunt. Scotty winked
at fellow team mates.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Stumped on the very first one,” he said, in
a loud voice, “and I’ve got plenty of others!”</p>

<p class='c007' >But Frederick, with confidence in his own
ability, was not admitting that he could not
duplicate Scotty’s performance. He suddenly
left his feet on a lunge to the side, struck the
ice on his hands and attempted the handspring.
He was off balance, however, and succeeded
only in throwing himself, joltingly.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Ha, ha, ha!” laughed Scotty. “She’s not
as simple as she looks, is she?”</p>

<p class='c007' >Frederick, red of face, got to his feet, painfully.
He immediately tried again with similar
embarrassing results.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Here’s an easier one,” cried Scotty, as the
crowd murmured its hilarity at the impromptu
skating match.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Look—he’s written his name ‘Scotty’!” exclaimed
an amazed spectator as Melville’s star
finished his complicated twistings and turnings.
“Marvelous!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Let’s see you write <em>your</em> name!” called
Scotty.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You think you’re clever!” flashed a greatly
chagrined Frederick. “I’ll show you...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >But the referee’s whistle screeched, announcing
time for the starting of the game.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Just a second!” Frederick pleaded as he
turned toward the referee.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Off the ice!” waved the referee, “all you
fellows who aren’t in the opening line-up!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Well, see you again some time!” razzed
Scotty.</p>

<p class='c007' >A thoroughly upset fancy skating champion
found his way to the bench and slumped down
upon it. He had not cared what might be
thought of him as a hockey player but to be
humiliated on his own rink in his own sport ...
this was terrible!</p>

<p class='c007' >It was half way through a blistering first
period before Coach Howard sent Frederick in,
along with two other spares, to replace Kirkwood’s
regular forward wall. The score was
nothing to nothing and the hot pace of the battle
had the crowd on edge.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Hello—if here isn’t Frederick, the Great!”
kidded Scotty. “Here’s hoping he’s as good a
hockey player as he is a fancy skater! If he is,
it’ll be duck soup!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Frederick glared. This Scotty had the habit
of ‘riding’ his opponents, all those who let themselves
be ‘ridden’. And Frederick was taking
the bait nicely.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You’ll never get past centre ice!” Scotty
predicted, as Frederick captured the puck a
few seconds later.</p>

<p class='c007' >Kirkwood’s substitute left wing said nothing
but skated back around his own cage and came
out on the other side with a burst of speed. He
put more behind his drive than he had ever displayed
in a game and the crowd cheered hopefully.
At mid-ice a crafty Scotty waited, grinning
as he saw his own left wing force Frederick
toward the centre, away from the sideboards.</p>

<p class='c007' >“He’s my meat!” muttered Melville’s star,
and hooked out his stick as Frederick tried
desperately to pass him. The crook of the
stick stole the puck so cleanly from Frederick
that he did not realize it was gone for several
flashing strides. When he did pull up short, it
was to hear the crowd roaring as Scotty, on a
scintillating dash into Kirkwood territory, had
fired a shot at goal-keeper Chub Roland. Chub
fended the puck off with his stick but Scotty,
following up, clubbed the disc viciously and sent
it flying past Chub into the net for the first goal
of the game!</p>

<p class='c007' >“There, Freddy!” taunted Scotty, as the
Melville stands went crazy with joy. “That’s
how to play hockey!”</p>

<p class='c007' >A hot retort was on the tip of Frederick, the
Great’s tongue when Coach Howard hastily
threw his regular forward wall back into the
game.</p>

<p class='c007' >The first period ended with Melville leading,
one to nothing, and Rand Downey, whose contempt
for the fancy skater exceeded that of his
team mates, had certain things to say to Frederick
in the locker room.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You let that baby talk you out of a score,”
he branded. “He got you so up in the air you
didn’t know whether you had a puck or an egg
at the end of your stick.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“He won’t get the puck away from me
again!” Frederick replied.</p>

<p class='c007' >“He won’t have to,” snapped Rand. “All
that Melville bunch has to make is one goal to
win their games. Here we are, playing our
fool heads off and you...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Oh, shut up!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Kirkwood’s right wing stared at Frederick
unbelievingly.</p>

<p class='c007' >“What did you say?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I said shut up!” repeated Frederick, a look
in his eyes that Rand had never seen before.</p>

<p class='c007' >Fellow team mates gasped their amazement.
Was Frederick actually commencing to come to
life?</p>

<p class='c007' >“How’s your ankle?” the coach asked Don
Keith, concernedly.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Holding up okay,” answered Kirkwood’s
veteran. “That Melville defense is the toughest
I ever went up against. We never got a puck
near their cage this period. They broke up
practically every formation at mid-ice. And
that guy Scotty is seemingly in every play!
Fred wasn’t to blame for that score.... Scotty
went through the entire team...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >The second period was a torrid repetition of
the first except that neither six was able to
score. Frederick twice got in the battle for
three minutes each, renewing his feud with
Scotty but accomplishing nothing. Instructions
were to play defensive hockey while the spares
were in. Should Melville jam through another
goal, Kirkwood’s every chance would be gone.
Now there was a glimmering possibility of a
tie resulting could Kirkwood get the puck past
goalie Pete Hardy who was fighting to establish
a season’s record of not having been scored
upon.</p>

<p class='c007' >“My ankle begins to feel lame,” Don admitted
during the intermission between the
second and last period. “Come on, boys—let’s
give ’em everything we’ve got. I’d like to take
the grin off that Scotty’s face!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“So would I!” echoed a voice, impulsively.</p>

<p class='c007' >Team members glanced about, questioningly.
The voice belonged to Don’s understudy, the
champion fancy skater. Frederick appeared
self-conscious and a bit confused as attention
focused upon him.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You ought to feel like taking Scotty’s grin
off,” rapped Rand, mercilessly, “you’re the guy
who put it on him!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I know it,” answered Frederick, lamely,
“but...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Aw, razzberries!” exploded Rand. “We’ve
had enough of you already!”</p>

<p class='c007' >A tired but grim Kirkwood six skated out on
the ice to resume hostilities in the third period.
Melville, deciding to coast in on the one goal
lead, threw up a stiffer defense than ever. As
the minutes crawled along, the one goal advantage
grew mountainous. Don Keith, handicapped
as he was by the weak ankle, had played
a stellar game but even his presence in the line-up
had failed to penetrate the Melville goal.
The visitors were just too good. Hats off to
the greatest team a state high school had ever
produced!</p>

<p class='c007' >“Oh, oh—Don is out!” A sympathetic murmur
went the rounds as Kirkwood’s right wing
was helped to the sidelines.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Go after ’em, Freddy!” Don called to the
man who was to substitute for him, as Frederick
got up from the bench, peeling off his sweater.
“Don’t let that Scotty kid you! He’d like to
make a monkey out of everybody if he could!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I know,” Frederick shot back. “I’ve got
a score to settle with him!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Certain fans could not suppress a groan as
Frederick, the Great, took Don Keith’s place.
But these certain fans had no way of knowing,
at the moment, that something had snapped
inside the champion fancy skater—a something
that had been holding him back for years. First
evidence of the change was a collision which
took place at mid-ice between party of the first
part and one Scotty Lathrom who became party
of the second part, and quite the most worsted
party, inasmuch as he did a backward somersault
following the impact while the party of
the first part simply rebounded and set off into
Melville territory at a blazing pace.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Yea, Frederick!” shrieked astonished Kirkwood
rooters, as the fellow who had never
shown any fighting spirit in a hockey match,
zig-zagged through to within fifteen feet of the
Melville cage and blazed away. His shot was
accurate, a startled Melville goalie warding it
off with his chest pad. Frederick became lost
the next instant in a slashing pile-up in front
of the Melville cage as he threw himself after
the puck, trying madly to get his stick on it
again and to drive it into the net for a score. It
was the first time during the game that Kirkwood
had gotten deep within Melville territory
and Frederick’s feat was immediately heartening
to his fellow players.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Face-off!” cried the referee, diving into
the mêlée and separating Scotty and Frederick,
both of whom had fallen over the puck.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You’re not mad are you?” joshed Scotty,
and grinned.</p>

<p class='c007' >As the puck was dropped between them,
Scotty knocked the puck to the side. It
whanged against the sideboards with Frederick
again in furious pursuit. He bumped shoulders
with Melville’s solidly built right defense and
sat down suddenly but was up in an instant and
trailing the defense man who had set off down
the ice. Frederick was using his speed and his
natural skating wizardry now as he glided
around from behind, crouched low, hooked the
puck away from the defense man, sent up a
shower of ice as he swerved and did an about-face.
Most of the Melville team was ahead of
him as he cut back toward the Melville goal
amid the wildest sort of clamor. A pop-eyed
Rand Downey came sliding in from nowhere,
pounding his stick on the ice.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Shoot it to me!” he yelled, “to me!”</p>

<p class='c007' >And Frederick shot, scooting the puck across
the ice on a perfect pass.</p>

<p class='c007' >Almost at once, Rand was covered, so that
he stopped short and swung to the side.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Right back at you!” he shouted, and backhanded
the puck on a sizzling drive.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Holy cats!” screamed Kirkwood’s veteran
right wing, dancing about on his injured ankle.
“Who said Freddy couldn’t play hockey? The
guy’s gone goofy! He’s a whiz! Look at him
spear that puck, will you? And look at him
dodge in there—right on top of the goalie!
Oh! Oh!... A perfect feint! He’s pulled the
goalie out of his cage and there goes his shot!...
It’s IN.... Man alive! Freddy’s the first
to put a puck inside that Melville net!!!...
Oh, am I glad I had to leave the game?...
Oh, this is wonderful!... Look at Scotty!...
Where’s that grin now, Scotty?... Tied
the old score, didn’t we?... How much time,
somebody?... Three minutes?... You <em>will</em>
kid that baby about his fancy skating, will you?...
Well, how was that for a <em>fancy</em> exhibition?”</p>

<p class='c007' >On the ice, Rand Downey put an arm around
the fellow he had cussed, and cried his apology.
Team members clapped a fussed Frederick on
the back. He knew what team spirit meant
now ... knew why fellows fought shoulder to
shoulder to try to win for each other ... knew
what real comradeship felt like for the first
time in his life. And knew it simply because
he had been wounded to the quick by an
opponent who had thought to have some fun at
his expense. Thwarted at answering Scotty’s
fancy skating challenge, Frederick’s only way
of getting back at him had been through direct
competition. And now he was finding what a
thrill actual combat really was! That backward
flip-flop that Scotty had taken as a result
of their meeting head-on had done Frederick
a world of good!</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m not through with you yet!” the fancy
skating champion told Melville’s star centre
as the puck went back to be faced off in the
centre circle.</p>

<p class='c007' >Melville team mates glumly consulted one
another. It was a shock to have been scored
upon since no other opponent had been able to
turn the trick. But this Frederick, the whoever
he was, would be a marked man from now on!
They’d bottle him up and put the cork in.</p>

<p class='c007' >The puck had scarcely been put back in play
than the cyclone struck Melville. It was twisting
and turning, taking a zigzag course over the
ice, threatening, receding, and threatening
again, as a goalie crouched in the mouth of the
cage like a Kansas farmer in a storm cellar,
afraid any moment that a little round, black
object might blow into the net and take the
game with it! Such an exhibition of skating
and stick handling had never been witnessed as
Kirkwood’s substitute left wing put on for the
edification of the crowd and one Scotty Lathrom
in particular. But Melville, fighting desperately
to stand off this tempestuous one-man attack,
stopped a stream of shots at the goal, fired
either by Frederick or one of his team mates
who had been placed in an advantageous position
due to his whizzing passwork.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Half a minute to play—looks like an overtime
game!” shouted someone.</p>

<p class='c007' >A terrific mix-up occurred at centre ice. The
cyclone went down, curling up in a heap and
with most of the wind taken out of it. Rand
Downey grabbed a dazed Frederick up and set
him on his feet. The referee’s whistle
screeched. It looked like someone was going to
be penalized but the official called no foul as
Scotty separated himself from the tangle and
stood swayingly on his feet to face a rival who
had shaken Melville’s defense to its foundations.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I still think you’re a rotten fancy skater!”
he taunted.</p>

<p class='c007' >But it was Frederick now who did the grinning.
And it was Frederick who got the puck
on the next face-off, blazing it down the ice
on an attempted long shot for goal. The shot
was blocked, however, by the Melville left
defense but he was set upon almost instantly by
Rand Downey and Steve Lucas and Bill Stewart—Kirkwood
sending a formation of four into
Melville territory in a last second effort to score.
So furious was the onslaught, players on both
sides went to the ice. In the mêlée the puck
was hit into the open between the struggling
group and the Melville cage. Scotty and
Frederick, near centre ice, set out in a race
for the disc. The heaving mass of players
blocked the direct path, so Scotty veered to go
around it.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Man, oh man—look at Frederick, will you?...”
gasped Don Keith. “He’s heading straight
for that gang on the ice. He must be going to
pull his airplane dive in order to beat Scotty to
the puck ... hey! There he goes...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Leaving his feet in a spectacular dive through
space, Frederick, the Great, Barker, cleared the
heads and forms of mates and foemen, arms
outstretched, to land on his chest and go sliding
across the ice, skimming directly in front of
Scotty who catapulted over him and went skidding
into the sideboards. Raking out his stick
as he slid along, never for one instant having
taken his eyes off the puck, the champion fancy
skater made connections, clipping the disc so
that it upended and rolled, skimming the leg of
Melville’s desperate goalie as it bounced over
and into a corner of the net.</p>

<p class='c007' >Bang!</p>

<p class='c007' >At the sound of the timer’s gun, Don Keith
deliriously hugged Coach Howard and Kirkwood
rooters did unaccountable things. They
tried mainly to get down on the ice and capture
a fellow who had written hockey history with
his skates and who was now jabbering about
writing something else for the especial benefit
of a crestfallen Scotty Lathrom who was sitting
dazedly where he had fallen, propped up against
the sideboards and staring unbelievingly at the
final score which read: Kirkwood, 2; Melville, 1.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Stick around!” cried the champion fancy
skater. “See if you can duplicate this!”</p>

<p class='c007' >And, despite the furious pace he had just
undergone, Kirkwood’s substitute left wing
started a series of intricate maneuvers which
held spectators spellbound. Melville team
members stopped to look on, Scotty crawling to
his feet that he might see the better. Finishing
with a flourish, the skater bowed mockingly in
the direction of his opponents as he pointed to
the lines he had etched into the scarred ice.</p>

<p class='c007' >Everyone strained their eyes for a moment,
then a great shout went up and Melville team
members made a hurried rush for the clubhouse,
Scotty leading the way. And well he might,
for Melville’s star centre had already seen more
than enough of the figure who had left his now
undisputed autograph on the ice:</p>

<div class='c004'><em>Frederick, the Great</em>....</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='story3' class='c009'>CRABBY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006' >Of course it was a nervy thing to do, we’ll
admit that, but just the same, if you’d known
old Crabby Jacobs the way we knew him, you
really wouldn’t have blamed us. According to
our figuring he had it coming to him ... and,
after all—what we did wasn’t any worse than
sending a person a terrible comic Valentine.
Besides, it had a good moral to it if Crabby
could only see it, and since this was the time of
year for people to turn over new leaves and
swear to be better and better in every way, why
shouldn’t Crabby be interested in the resolutions
we’d drawn up for him?</p>

<p class='c007' >I’m not saying whose idea it was since that
would be giving me away but I will say this—that
all the fellows fell for it at once and Dill,
who was taking a sign painting course up
at high school, volunteered to fix up what
was written so that old Crabby couldn’t miss
seeing it.</p>

<p class='c007' >I suppose now you’re wondering who Crabby
was and just why we had it in for him. Well,
that won’t take long to tell. Crabby Jacobs was
the old geezer who lived by himself in a nice-enough
house right close to the bend in the Pierson’s
Hill road. Where he lived was just outside
the limits of the town and the reason he
lived there, we guessed, was because he was a
good three blocks away from any neighbors. Of
course the old fairground property was across
the road from him but none of the rickety frame
buildings had been used for years. And hardly
anybody used the steep Pierson’s Hill road except
in the winter when it made the best sliding
for miles around. At the top of the hill, a
quarter of a mile above Crabby Jacobs’ place,
farmer Durgan and his wife and seven kids
lived ... and he was sort of accustomed to boys
because he was always mighty nice to us when
we’d come out with our toboggans to start in
coasting. Why, he even got out his horse one
time and helped us level off the snow in places
where it was too deep for our runners to track.
But Crabby? Say ... it was at the bend, halfway
down this mile long hill, that we’d be
hitting it up at the greatest speed and it was
right here that we’d get stuck. Crabby wasn’t
going to have any sliding past his place. No
siree! It was a darn nuisance to begin with ...
and we was always shoutin’ and carryin’ on and
he didn’t like it a little bit ... not a little bit!</p>

<p class='c007' >“But Mr. Jacobs,” we’d argue, “you don’t
own the road and we’ll promise not to make a
sound when we’re going by and we don’t see
how we’re interfering with anything you’re
doing!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I ain’t goin’ to argue!” he’d reply. “You
boys know what’s right. Besides, coastin’ is
dangerous. You might run into somebody
comin’ around that bend or tip over and hurt
yourselves. I’m really doin’ you boys a favor
by keepin’ you from riskin’ your necks and this
is the thanks I get. Go along now and don’t let
me catch you slidin’ past here again!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Well, what are you going to do with a customer
like this? Old Crabby Jacobs has a good-sized
temper when it’s stirred up and we don’t
care to get in a fight with anybody. On the
other hand we hate like sixty to give up the
swellest coasting we’d had in years.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Ought to be some way to get around
Crabby,” says Pete Bagley.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Or else to get even with him,” explodes Rod
Evans.</p>

<p class='c007' >And so we get the idea of the New Year’s
resolutions. And Dill Saunders, with his knack
for lettering, prints what we’ve thought up on
a big piece of cardboard to which we tie a string
like we was going to hang a picture. Then we
hike out to Crabby Jacobs’ and while the fellows
hide down around the bend, me and Pete sneak
up to Crabby’s door and hang the sign on the
door knob and then bang on the door real loud.
After that we does a different kind of coasting
to get out of sight.</p>

<p class='c007' >It isn’t ten seconds later when Crabby comes
out on the porch in his shirt sleeves, acting suspicious
and excited. He looks all around but
he can’t see anything so he starts back into the
house and then he sees plenty! He lets out a
gasp which, on account of the cold air, turns into
a puff of white and we can tell from that,
he’s steaming hot. There’s a lot of little white
puffs follows as he reads to himself what’s
printed on the sign.</p>

<p class='c010' >I, Crabby Jacobs, do hereby resolve—</p>

<p class='c011' >To get over being cranky</p>

<p class='c011' >To smile at least once a day</p>

<p class='c011' >To remember that I used to be
young once</p>

<p class='c011' >To let the boys coast past my house
because it’s the only real coasting
place around and I’m the only one
who’s MEAN enough to spoil their
fun as all the other property owners
don’t mind!</p>

<p class='c007' >Wow! You should have seen Crabby’s face
when he gets through reading this! It’s a
fiery red and he’s jumping about on the front
porch, waving his arms as agitated as a kernel of
pop corn that’s getting ready to pop.</p>

<p class='c007' >If Crabby could have caught us right then
he’d have broken all the resolutions we’d made
out for him at once. He’s wise enough to know,
though, that we must be peeking at him from
some place, so he goes to each end of the porch
and shakes his fist at the empty air, hoping he’s
shaking it in our direction. Then he stamps
back to the door, tears the sign off and takes it
inside, slamming the door after him so hard
it’s a wonder he don’t jerk it off the hinges.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Well,” says Pete, when the eruption is over,
“I guess we’ve fixed things now.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Yes,” says Dill, mournfully, “and just
think what’s going to happen to that sign
I took so much pains lettering. All my beautiful
art work ruined!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“On top of that,” adds Rod, “he’s probably
making up a resolution all his own....
‘I hereby resolve to shoot every member of the
gang on sight’!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Maybe so,” I admits, “just the same I’m not
sorry we did what we did. Crabby at least
knows right where we stand.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“And meanwhile,” moans Pete, “we’ve got
to sit through this swell sliding weather....”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Which we’d have had to do anyhow,” I
reminds. “You guys wait a little while. Don’t
jump on this idea too quick. Give those resolutions
time to bump around inside Crabby’s
head. You can’t tell ... he might all of a sudden
get <em>magnanimous</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“If he gets anything like that word sounds,”
says Rod, doubtfully, “there’s no hope for us.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Go on!” I laughs. “I had to define that
word and I know what it means—to raise yourself
above what is low, mean and ungenerous’!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Rod shakes his head.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Less hope than ever,” he comes back.
“Fellows, we might as well put up our toboggan
and go in for ice skating. As long as Crabby’s
on this hill, we’re sunk!”</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007' >It’s a wise army that knows when it’s defeated
because then it doesn’t waste time fighting
for lost causes or suffering any needless
casualties ... and, in our case, we don’t have
to do any more scouting to know that our one-man
enemy will be on the warpath with double
vengeance from now on. So, though we outnumber
him nine to one, we decide to follow
the words of the bird who said, “discretion’s
the better part of valor” and to steer clear of
Crabby altogether.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Only thing I wish for now,” says Dill, “is
a thaw!... If this good sliding weather keeps
up it’s going to be a heartbreaker.”</p>

<p class='c007' >But you might know the weather man would
want to rub it in. Seems like somebody must
have told him we couldn’t use Pierson’s Hill
for coasting because he hands out a perfect assortment
of cold, clear days and moonlight
nights with just enough snow sprinkled in to
make us cry for mercy.</p>

<p class='c007' >“If that hill was only inside the city limits
I’d be for taking the matter up with the town
council,” says Pete, “and getting them to pass
an ordinance ordering the road to be closed for
our use. Then old Crabby could holler his head
off and it wouldn’t do him any good.”</p>

<p class='c007' >But though we exercised our brains every
way we knew how, we couldn’t seem to hit on a
plan of getting old Crabby to be a sport. He
just didn’t give a care what other folks did so
long as they didn’t irritate him. And the
moment they did, he let them hear about it.
After that folks would usually leave Crabby
alone like we were doing ... which meant that
he’d come off victorious, whether he was right
or wrong.</p>

<p class='c007' >About a week later, when we’re all feeling
something like Washington’s soldiers that winter
at Valley Forge, Rod comes running up with
a piece of real news.</p>

<p class='c007' >“What do you know, guys?” he shouts. “I
just came by the depot and Crabby’s leaving
town!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Get off!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“He never left town in his life!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Quit your kidding!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Absolute fact!” replies Rod. “I can’t believe
my eyes but I sneak up and speak to the
ticket agent and he tells me Crabby’s been called
to Northport on account of the serious illness
of his sister.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Gee, that’s too bad,” says Pete. “I mean, in
another way, it’s pretty good!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“How long do you suppose he’ll be gone?”
I asks.</p>

<p class='c007' >“No idea,” answers Rod, “but figure it out
for yourself—if she’s good and sick she won’t
be over it in a day. Say, if this weather only
holds out...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Now’s when it’ll probably thaw,” puts in
Dill, with his usual pessimism, “but let’s go out
and see what the slide looks like.”</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007' >It’s about a mile across town to Pierson’s Hill
from where we are but that mile disappears in a
little over five minutes. Just goes to show how
crazy we were about coasting.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Say, guys, the hill’s in great shape!” calls
Pete, who’s beaten us by half a block. “She’s
iced!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Sure enough! There’s walls of snow on both
sides the road but the tracks in the center are
worn down and frozen where farmer Durgan
has driven his heavy sled into town and back.
We start climbing the hill, smoothing out a few
rough places as we go. It isn’t long before we
come in sight of Crabby’s house, setting up there
on the bend.</p>

<p class='c007' >“See,” points out Rod, “he’s gone all right.
The blinds are all down.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Boy, oh boy!” chuckled Dill. “I’m not
wishing his sister any bad luck but...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >And then we come close to the bend and all
the fellows let out a holler at once as they caught
a glimpse of the hill.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Well, what do you know about this?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“The old skinflint!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Sand!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Sand is right. Bright, yellow sand sprinkled
thick all across the road up above, around and
below the bend. Sand by the wheelbarrow load
and a little path dug in the snow from a window
in his basement to the edge of the bluff
where it had been dumped off on the road. All
this testifying to the fact that Crabby Jacobs
had worked hard and long to keep us from
having any fun while he was gone.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Gee, looks like he’d almost undermined his
house to get the sand to do this!” observes Dill,
glumly. “But leave it to Crabby to put a crimp
in us. It’ll take us two nights to get this hill in
shape for sliding....”</p>

<p class='c007' >“And by that time he may be back,” groans
Pete.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Besides,” says Rod, “there’s no water near
here to put on the road after we clear off the
sand. We’ll have to carry it clear from Mr.
Durgan’s!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Just the same,” I puts in, “let’s show Crabby
he can’t stump us. We’re going to coast on this
hill while he’s away no matter how much work
it takes to fix things.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“You bet we are!” echoes Pete, and the gang
chimes in.</p>

<p class='c007' >It turns out to be some job! Even worse
than we expect. We set to work with shovels
to clear away the sand and then pack in some
new snow and pour water over it from pails
we’ve loaded on our toboggan and carried from
Durgan’s.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Old Mr. Jacobs is mighty sore, boys,”
warns Mr. Durgan. “Better be sure you’re not
around when he comes back. I think you’re
taking a chance trying to slide on this hill
again.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Well, he can’t do any more than chase us
off,” answers Dill, but Mr. Durgan shakes his
head.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You can’t tell,” he says. “Mr. Jacobs is
a mighty queer man.”</p>

<p class='c007' >All of which doesn’t help us feel any better.
But the second night we’ve got the hill in wonderful
shape and we’re having such a good time
that we forget all about Crabby even existing.
Talk about coasting! Say, the first time down
the hill we broke all long distance records. You
know, Pierson’s creek is at the bottom and the
farthest we’d ever gone before was just to the
bridge but this trip we’re still traveling like the
wind and go about half a block beyond ... a
good mile and a quarter’s slide.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Wow!” yells Pete. “If we never take
another coast, this was worth all the trouble
we’ve been to...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Yeah,” kids Dill, “but remember this ...
the farther we slide, the farther we’ve got to
walk back!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“In the snow for that wisecrack!” say Rod,
and pushes Dill head first into a big drift.</p>

<p class='c007' >You can see from this how good we’re feeling.
The old moon is out, a little lopsided but
almost full. There’s quite a stiff breeze
blowing, though, which races big hunks of clouds
across the sky. The kind of weather Pete says
is nice enough now but which has all the earmarks
of a change.</p>

<p class='c007' >Well, we’re on our way up the hill again,
talking and joshing, when the wind brings us
the three long toots of the night train as it’s
coming into town and somehow it makes us all
think of a certain party.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I wonder how Crabby’s sister is?” Rod
asks, kind of casual like.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Aw, he’s only been gone a little over two
days,” scoffs Pete. “You needn’t be expecting
him back yet!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I know ... but maybe that’s all the longer
his sister could stand him,” Rod comes back,
with a grin. “Anyhow, I don’t breathe easy till
half an hour after every train comes in!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Especially when we’ve all got a sneaking
hunch that Crabby, after going to all that work,
isn’t going to stay away any longer’n he can
help!” sums up Dill.</p>

<p class='c007' >I couldn’t tell you now, as I think back, who
it was that saw what we saw, right then, first.
But I’m here to state that the first glimpse we
all got of it sure made our blood tingle.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Look!” we all seemed to holler at once.
“The old fairgrounds!”</p>

<p class='c007' >On fire! Yes, sir ... and all of a sudden
crackling noise followed by a puff and one of
the rickety frame buildings across the road from
Crabby Jacobs’ house bulges at the sides so that
fire and smoke comes roaring through. And
in no time there’s a bright red reflection in the
sky growing lighter all the while until the
moon’s not in it for illumination.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Gee!” cries Pete. “Looks like the whole
fairgrounds is going! You suppose we’ll be
blamed for it?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Why should we?” I asks, as we’re running
up the hill to the bend.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Well, it had to start somehow and we seem
to be the only guys around!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“It’s tramps that’s done it!” hollers Rod.
“I saw two dirty looking men hanging around
over there about half an hour ago!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Sure, but how you going to prove it?”
Pete wants to know. “We’d better dig out of
here!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“No use,” says I. “If we’re going to be
blamed, we can’t help it now. Our folks know
where we are and....”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Look at that fire travel!” yells Dill. “There
goes the building next the road. If it wasn’t
for this wind!...”</p>

<p class='c007' >“No fire protection out this far, either,” says
Pete. “That’s why the fairgrounds was moved.”</p>

<p class='c007' >We’re up close to the blaze now and it’s
easily the biggest fire I’ve ever seen. All the
old barns and sheds and display buildings that
have been falling to pieces on account of being
out of repair make the swellest kind of kindling
wood and the flames, helped out by the wind,
are leaping high in the air, sucking out for new
things to burn. It’s a great sight.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Some hot!” shouts Rod, backing up. “Say,
it’s melting the ice on our slide!”</p>

<p class='c007' >It is for a fact! The banks of snow are disappearing
along the road, too, on account of
the heat.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Old Crabby must have cast a spell over this
hill!” says Pete as we all feel a kind of uncanny
feeling creep over us.</p>

<p class='c007' >Then, Dill, who’s watching the flames and
sparks as the wind’s carrying ’em high across the
road, grabs me by the arm and points toward
Crabby’s house. Holy smoke! There’s a spot
on the roof that’s took fire!</p>

<p class='c007' >“Goodbye!” calls Rod. “Now we’ll be
blamed sure!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“We might beat that out,” figures Pete, “if
we could get inside and up on the roof.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Yeah, but who’s going to break into Crabby’s
house?” replies Dill. “Not me!”</p>

<p class='c007' >The little spot on the roof begins to grow
bigger.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Good night!” yells Pete. “There’s another
place! In a minute she’ll be a goner!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Honest, I’m standing there, looking on, and
no matter how hard I try I can’t help feeling
sorry for old Crabby. Somehow, it comes over
me just then how awful alone he must be and
how little real joy he must be getting out of
life ... and then to come back and find the only
place that’s been any comfort to him in
ashes...! Well, after thinking of this, if
I’ve had any temptation to rejoice over his misfortune
on account of the way he’s treated us, it’s
gone in a hurry.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Fellows!” I says, “We’ve got to figure some
way to save that house!”</p>

<p class='c007' >The boys look at me as though they think I’m
crazy. Not that they wouldn’t have been glad
to have done what they could but the whole
thing looks so hopeless. And then the idea
comes to me!</p>

<p class='c007' >“Quick, guys!” I calls. “This melting
snow! It’s great packing! We’ll soak it up
on the roof!”</p>

<p class='c007' >I don’t need to go any further. The fellows
are diving into the snow p. d. q. and in less than
a minute we’ve got a firing line in operation.
It takes us a few seconds to get the range but
pretty soon great gobs of snow are landing on
top and all around the blazing spots and it isn’t
long before the spots send up a hissing noise,
grow dim, and then go black out. But now
the old fairgrounds fire is at its height and firebrands
are blowing across the road and dropping
on Crabby’s house like hailstones. By this time
folks from town have commenced arriving and
some of them join us in the battle. We
keep peppering Crabby’s roof from all sides,
aiming at every place where a blazing spark
or firebrand lands and it’s a merry fight to
keep these places from getting beyond our
control.</p>

<p class='c007' >“If we could only get inside!” says Pete,
when it looks like all we can do isn’t going to
be enough.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Here’s Mr. Jacobs now!” cries someone,
and the next instant the most frenzied individual
you ever saw comes running up. He takes in
what we’re doing at a glance.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Poor old duffer!” someone else says. “He’s
run all the way out from town!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Boys!” gasps Mr. Jacobs, sinking down on
the front steps, exhausted, “Here’s my keys!
If you’d like to get to the roof...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >I’m nearest to old Crabby and I grab the keys
and rush up to the door calling to the fellows to
follow me.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Hurry!” yells a spectator, “There’s quite a
blaze on the south side!”</p>

<p class='c007' >It doesn’t take us long, once we get in, to race
up the stairs, into the attic and to climb out onto
the roof from there where, joining hands, we
lower Pete to where the worst blaze is. Pete,
using his heavy woolen jacket, beats out the
flames ... and the crowd cheers.</p>

<p class='c007' >Looking down, I see the white face of old
Crabby staring up and hear him shout, in a
high, nervous voice: “That’s the way, boys!...
That’s the way!”</p>

<p class='c007' >We stick on the roof after that till the danger’s
all over and then, tuckered out, we slide
into the attic and crawl down the ladder into
the house.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Whew!” says Dill, “I’m glad I don’t have
to fight fires for a living!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“All I can say is,” joshes Pete in a low voice,
“it’s a lucky thing for Crabby we decided to go
coasting no matter how hard he tried to keep
us from it. Otherwise we wouldn’t have been
out here and Crabby would have been
minus....”</p>

<p class='c007' >Just then, as we reach the first floor landing,
we come face to face with a familiar looking
something.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Our resolutions!” cries Dill. “And look—he
... he’s <em>signed</em> ’em!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Sure enough. There’s our cardboard with
Dill’s fancy lettering, propped up against the
wall. The heading “I, Crabby Jacobs, do hereby
resolve—” stands out strong and, in large
but shaky handwriting, on the line we’ve drawn
for his signature, there’s the name “<em>Crabby</em>
Jacobs”....</p>

<p class='c007' >Say, you’ll think we’re soft ... but there’s
something wet comes into our eyes as we look
and Dill expresses how we feel when he says,
kind of embarrassed, “Gee, guys, when we
wanted water we couldn’t get it and now....”</p>

<p class='c007' >Crabby?... Naw—no one calls him that any
more. Resolutions? Well, the way he’s
lived up to the ones we made out for him has
made us sort of ashamed of the resolutions
we’ve been trying to keep!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='story4' class='c009'>THE SKI BATTLE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006' >To begin with, Reed Markham of the Georgia
Markhams, had never seen it snow until his
<em>Pappy</em> sent him north to a finishing school. He
came of what has been described as “warm
Southern blood” which perhaps partially explained
his feeling that northern schoolmates at
Seldon Prep were “cold” to him.</p>

<p class='c007' >“No wonder you people have to have steam
radiators in your homes!” he had been reported
as saying once, when provoked at Yankee coolness.</p>

<p class='c007' >But if Reed, fresh from a land rich in the
lore of good old-fashioned hospitality, had felt
his sensitive nature react to the more reserved
attitudes of those new to him, he had only to
remain long enough for cold weather to set in to
know that the climate was even icier than the
people.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Brrr!” he murmured, teeth chattering, on
the first stinging day of fall. “Why did Pop
ever send me to this part of the country? This
is terrible! I suppose I’ll have to go out and
get some heavy underwear and a ... what’s that
word?... yes—a <em>winter</em> overcoat!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Soft spoken, soft acting, with soft brown eyes
and softer black hair, Reed Markham had slid
softly into Seldon at the start of the school term.
A naturally diffident youth, possessing none too
much inclination to make advances, Reed had
resented the failure of fellow schoolmates to
approach him. On the few occasions that they
had, his white teeth had shown, the soft eyes
had warmed with a grateful smile and he had
done his best to make friends. But a certain
self-conscious something—a feeling that he was
among fellows who thought differently and
acted differently than himself—had always
erected a barrier. Sadly, more often bewilderedly,
Reed had realized, even as he was
speaking to a northern schoolmate, that the
youth was not opening up to him. He wondered
not a little about this Mason and Dixon
line business. Why should fellows be humanly
different just because they lived in different
parts of the country? Weren’t they all Americans?
Reed controlled a hot-tempered tongue
with difficulty. His softness was a matter of
breeding; his temper a matter of inheritance.
A fellow must be the gentleman at all times—according
to the best traditions of the Markham
family. What Reed unfortunately could not
know was that his Southern drawl and his obvious
culture had been mistaken by his new
acquaintances for a sense of superiority.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Thinks he’s too good for us!” Sam Hartley,
star athlete of the school had declared, after
sizing Reed up. “If this is a sample of Georgia
crackers...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >But Reed had merely felt, in his retiring way,
that he—a stranger—should be welcomed by
the residents of the north and made to feel at
home. Down South, these same fellows would
be greeted with unmistakable signs of hospitality,
having only to reflect this warmth in
return to be accepted in the community. For
him, however, to make the first advances in this
northern atmosphere, would be a breach of
... well ... call it ‘etiquette’...!</p>

<p class='c007' >The first snowfall Reed had ever witnessed
commenced one frigid morning while he was
in school. Great, crystal-shaped wet flakes began
drifting down, much to his amazement and
interest as he gazed from his desk out the window.
Yes, he had heard of snow. He had even
learned the dictionary definition for it—‘ice in
the form of white or transparent crystals or
flakes congealed in the air from particles of
water, and falling or fallen to the earth.’ And
here it was—in the process of <em>falling</em>! A quite
strange and beautiful sight, Reed thought, recalling
pictures he had seen in news reels of
snow-covered country, snow battles and snow
slides. There was something cotton-like in the
flakes which nestled on the window sill and
fluffily covered it. Reed felt a twinge in his
throat that he knew to be homesickness.</p>

<p class='c007' >At recess that day, the two hundred other
fellows in Seldon Prep made a mad dash for the
out-of-doors, plunging into the thickly falling
snow and scooping up handfuls of it to pack
into snowballs. Reed, standing timidly in the
shelter of the doorway, watched a merry battle
being waged, numerous snowballs landing with
eye-smacking accuracy. He saw Sam Hartley,
who seemed to be the ringleader, single-handedly
stand off a concerted attempt to roll
him in the snow, tripping up his adversaries,
stopping them with whizzing snowballs and
dodging back and forth across the campus,
laughing the while.</p>

<p class='c007' >“It looks like real sport,” Reed admitted to
himself.</p>

<p class='c007' >He was not, however, invited to take part.
In fact the fellows appeared oblivious that he
was even looking on, having relegated him to
the sidelines in their activities weeks before.
To voluntarily enter into the fun, Reed could
never do. Reaching down he caught up a bit
of the snow and crushed it beneath his fingers,
watching it melt against the warmth of his
hand.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Funny stuff!” he said.</p>

<p class='c007' >At that moment the boisterously engaged Sam
detected him and became suddenly inspired.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Hey, fellows!” he shouted. “Look at Reed!
He’s not used to snow. Let’s initiate him!”</p>

<p class='c007' >And, before the lad from the South could
retreat, the Northern army was upon him.
Protesting, Reed was dragged out to the center
of the campus where grinning youths grabbed
up the wet snow and applied it none too gently to
his face.</p>

<p class='c007' >“That’s the way—give him the old face
wash!” laughed Sam. “How’s that snow feel,
Reed? Must be pretty dull down South in the
winter time, eh?”</p>

<p class='c007' >Reed’s brown eyes flashed as he renewed his
struggles to get free, snow in his hair and
nostrils.</p>

<p class='c007' >“And now some down his neck!” someone
cried.</p>

<p class='c007' >Reed felt his collar roughly pulled from the
neck and a chilling, spine-tingling sensation
as a cold, wet lump went sliding down.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You guys let me go!” he gasped. “I can’t
stand this!... Oh!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“You’ll get accustomed to it!” Sam reassured.
“This snow is just a starter. It usually gets three
and four feet deep here.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Reed groaned inwardly. Snow might have
been nice to look at but it was far from attractive
or pleasant rubbed on his face and shoved
down his back. If the fellows thought this was
sport ... and intended to hand out such treatment
through the winter ... well, he’d pack
up his duds and beat it for home. He just
didn’t fit in this atmosphere anyway. His
father should have known better than to send
him to such a place.</p>

<p class='c007' >“If Pop knew what I have to put up with!”
Reed moaned to himself. “I’ll have to write
him about it. When he understands...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >The letter of complaint to the elder Markham
was dispatched special delivery that same
night, after Reed had made a complete change
of clothes and taken a hot bath for fear of possible
consequences. To his relief, he contracted
no cold, which indicated that he was hardier
than he had supposed, having apparently stood
the exposure to snow as well as his northern
schoolmates.</p>

<p class='c007' >“That’s something, anyhow,” he said, with
a measure of satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c007' >His father’s reply, also by special delivery,
proved disconcertingly unsatisfactory. Rather
than sympathizing with his son’s growing predicament
and distaste for the north, the senior
Markham wrote in part:</p>

<p class='c010' >“I’m frankly ashamed of you, Reed.
I spent three of the happiest years of my
late boyhood in the north. Did you ever
stop to think that it might not be the other
fellows—but you?... Analyze yourself,
my boy, and see if you can discover
what’s wrong.</p>

<p class='c013' >“What’s a ducking or two in the snow?
Haven’t I seen you dive unflinchingly into
iced swimming pools? Give me a few dabs
of snow every time.</p>

<p class='c013' >“I’m afraid the fellows are apt to put
you down as a poor sport. I must tell you,
that is the main reason I insisted on your
going north to school ... you were becoming
too self-centered. Your boy
friends here knew you too well. They were
humoring your weaknesses. Don’t write
me, son, unless it’s about your triumphs.
After all, you know, you’re a Markham
... and, while a Markham may have his
faults, he doesn’t quit....”</p>

<p class='c014' >Reed read and re-read what he considered
to be an amazing letter. His apparently easygoing,
soft-spoken father had suddenly spit fire.
No mincing of words here—straight from the
shoulder stuff. Even the South, it seemed,
could be cold and unfeeling on occasion. Reed
bit his lips and slipped the letter in a drawer
of his desk.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I won’t write Pop at all,” he said, with a
flare of hurt Southern pride. “But I’ll stick
this out, somehow ... or die trying!”</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007' >Sam Hartley, of all the fellows Reed had so
much as a speaking acquaintance with, became
the most detested. As the winter tightened its
grip and ice and snow sports were more and
more indulged in, the taunting Sam seemed to
personify the aggravation of the entire school
in its relation to the student from the South.</p>

<p class='c007' >“If he doesn’t leave me alone pretty soon,
something’s going to happen!” Reed decided
one day after submitting to considerable torment.
Among other things he had been caught
and forced to dive head first into a five foot
drift, being first compelled to climb to the top of
a fence post as the diving point. Such stunts as
this but increased Reed’s hatred for snow and
further outraged his estimate of northern fellows.</p>

<p class='c007' >“They’re nothing but a bunch of roughnecks!”
Reed denounced in private, “who take
most of their delight in making me miserable!
How I’d like to get even with the crowd of
them!”</p>

<p class='c007' >If wishes had been the father of thoughts,
Reed would have been given the power to douse
each of the two hundred fellows in the ice-caked
water fountain which graced the campus.
He would have shouted in fiendish delight at
their discomfiture, quite willingly forgetting
the supposed propensities of the gentleman.
Even a gentleman, Reed had about made up his
mind, could give vent, under due provocation,
to an expression of righteous indignation. To
make the instance more concrete, his patience
was being tried to the point of exasperation.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I wonder what I might be able to do to turn
the tables?” Reed commenced to ask himself.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007' >There is an old saying that “he who asks
a question must find the answer” or, with equal
aptness: “the answer must find him who asks
the question.” In this case the answer found
Reed in the form of Seldon’s Annual Winter
Carnival.</p>

<p class='c007' >“As you boys all know,” announced the dean
in chapel one morning, “this Carnival attracts
the populace of the town and surrounding countryside.
It has become an occasion to be anticipated.
Particularly the spectacular ski jumping
event down the now famous slide of Seldon
Hill. This season, Sam Hartley, our ski jumping
champion has assured me that he will be
out to break his former record jump of one
hundred and nine feet....”</p>

<p class='c007' >The rest of Dean Hogart’s announcement
suddenly meant nothing to one Reed Markham
who had been listening, up to this time, with
lukewarm interest. Sam Hartley!... Sam
Hartley!... Sam Hartley!... There didn’t
appear to be an activity worthwhile in which he
did not prominently figure. Reed was sick of
hearing the name mentioned. It was about time
that Mr. Hartley was taken down a few pegs.
He had the other fellows under his thumb. A
suggestion from him and they’d all but tear the
school down ... or turn upon the only student
from the South to perpetrate further hazings.
How they loved to pick on him! And how this
Sam Hartley person enjoyed his leadership!</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ve dived from a sixty foot perch and I’ve
sailed gliders,” Reed considered, quietly. “I
wonder if that’s anything like the sensation of
shooting through the air on skis?”</p>

<p class='c007' >With the Carnival but one month away, the
majority of the two hundred students went
into training for the various sporting events to
be run off. The slide, thanks to abundant snow,
was in excellent condition and, the first night of
practice, Reed waited in the clearing below the
incline to watch a group of schoolmates, led by
the one and only Sam Hartley, take the jumps.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Wow!” cried a townsman as Hartley was
seen to be whizzing down the slide, first to
take-off from long-established precedent. “What
form that baby has! Look at his forward crouch
... watch him straighten after he leaves the
incline ... there he goes—soaring like a
bird! Isn’t that beautiful? Oh! Oh! He
spoiled his landing ... took a header....”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Yes, I see he did!” commented Reed, with
a surge of satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c007' >But Reed’s blood had tingled at the sight of
this magnificently built youth skimming down
the slide. Whatever he might think of Hartley
personally, he was forced now to concede that
the fellow had a natural athletic grace which
approached perfection. This was the second
sport Reed had seen him in, the first sport having
been football.</p>

<p class='c007' >“This looks like his star event,” he estimated.
“And it looks like something I could do if I just
had a chance to get in some practice without the
fellows being wise...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Skiing, as the boy from the land of no snow
was to discover, was not the easy sport he had
imagined. Old Steve Turner, recreational director
of Seldon Prep, had smiled as he had
listened to Reed’s “confidential” proposal.</p>

<p class='c007' >“But why do you want to learn how to
ski when the other fellows aren’t around?”</p>

<p class='c007' >The Southerner’s face flushed. “Because
I’ve been laughed at enough,” he retorted, and
felt sorry that he had even brought himself to
speak to the Coach. Northerners were all alike—old
or young.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Perhaps,” suggested Old Steve, observing
the youth closely, “if you learned how to laugh
at yourself before you tried to learn how to ski,
you’d get along better.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I guess,” was Reed’s rejoinder, “you folks
up here have a different sense of humor than I
have.”</p>

<p class='c007' >But the upshot of Reed’s request that he be
taught how to ski in private, was the granting
of a concession by Coach Turner wherein Reed
was to be excused from his last two study hours
for skiing practice on the promise that he would
make them up out of school.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Winter sports are all new to me,” Reed explained,
his heart warming to the Coach’s unexpected
kindness. “The other fellows are taking
advantage of it. But I’ve stood just about as
much as I’m going to!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“That’s the spirit!” Coach Turner encouraged.</p>

<p class='c007' >Reed Markham had always been a conundrum
to Seldon’s recreational director, he was
secretly glad to see the boy venturing from his
shell.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You get some skis,” the Coach proposed,
“and I’ll meet you for an hour every day on the
old ball field.” Then the Coach’s face widened
in a grin. “But, remember, son—you’re setting
out to learn a strictly northern sport. You
can’t take this skiing knowledge back to Georgia
with you and do anything with it!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I know that!” flashed Reed, in a revelation
of pent-up feeling. “But you Northerners
think you’re so darn good in
everything ... I’d like to show you what I can do at your own
sport!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Go to it!” Coach Turner invited, good-naturedly.
“I’ll help all I can!”</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007' >Curiosity of fellow students was aroused with
Reed Markham’s continued absence from the
study periods at school and this curiosity was intensified
when it was rumored around by townspeople
that the Southerner had been seen in the
company of Coach Turner, both with skis under
their arms, hurrying for the enclosure of the
ball field. As the gates were locked, it was impossible
to see what was taking place within but
the inference was evident.</p>

<p class='c007' >“So Softy’s going in for skiing!” Sam Hartley
taunted one day as he encountered Reed on
the campus.</p>

<p class='c007' >The Southerner glanced coldly at the fellow
whom he so thoroughly detested.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Well, what of it?” he asked, controlling his
smoldering temper with difficulty. This
“Softy” nom de plume was a new one.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Doesn’t Softy know that skiing is a he-man’s
sport?” was Sam’s kidding inquiry. “Softy
doesn’t like snow ... he hates to be rolled in
it. What’s he going to do when he gets his skis
crossed going down hill? Or is he just going
to ski on the level?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“None of your business!” Reed retorted.</p>

<p class='c007' >Sam laughed and the other fellows with him
laughed. The idea of a Southerner ... this
Southerner, anyway, taking up the manly sport
of skiing! Of course the use of the snow was
free.</p>

<p class='c007' >“When you think you’re good,” Sam continued,
“come over on the slide some night and
I’ll give you a few lessons on ski jumping.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The fellows winked at one another. If they
could ever get Reed Markham on the slide it
would be the greatest sport ever. There was no
doubt about it—he would be a riot. They could
just see him now, his first time down the snow
chute, speeding up the incline and floundering
off into space! What a howl!</p>

<p class='c007' >“Yes,” urged Tom Carrow, one of Sam’s
friends and closest rival in the ski jump. “Or,
better yet—perhaps you can show <em>us</em> something?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I doubt that,” said Reed, bitingly, “you
fellows know all that’s to be known!”</p>

<p class='c007' >And when he walked off, it was Sam
who, looking after him, remarked: “There goes
the queerest duck I’ve ever met. He’s got spunk,
though. Now what the deuce do you suppose
he’s taking up skiing for? With that superior
attitude of his, I should think he’d consider
skiing beneath him just because we go in for it!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Efforts to discover Reed’s possible intentions
from Coach Turner proved unavailing.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Reed is preparing for a climactic change
which he expects is going to effect Georgia in
the next half century,” the recreational director
explained, in all apparent seriousness. “When
Georgia’s first big snow comes, Reed hopes to
lead his oppressed people from the wilderness...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Applesauce!” branded the inquisitive group
about the Coach.</p>

<p class='c007' >“What if it is?” grinned the director. “I
like <em>applesauce</em>.”</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007' >Reed Markham’s entry in the ski jumping
contest proved the biggest sensation in the history
of the school. Students just couldn’t bring
themselves to believe it although reports, the
last week prior to the Annual Winter Carnival,
told of Reed’s going down the slide. While
none of the school fellows were eye witnesses,
some of the townspeople had paused in their
day’s occupations to watch Coach Turner and
his lone pupil. They had seen the pupil take
three successive tumbles—two at the take-off.
“Nasty spills,” as one townsman had characterized
it. “If I’d taken any one of ’em I’d have
stacked my skis and called it quits. But this kid
picks himself up and crawls back up the hill to
begin all over again. He listens pretty close to
what his Coach has to say and watches this man
Turner take a couple of jumps. Then down he
goes again. You say he’s a Southerner and he’s
been practicing skiing less than a month? Well,
you’d never know it!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Sam Hartley, meeting Reed after his name
had been posted on the bulletin board as a competitor
in the feature event, could not resist a
crack. He noticed as he spoke that Reed was
limping.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Well, so you took my tip and tried out jumping?
How’d you like it?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Nothing much to it,” was Reed’s laconic
reply.</p>

<p class='c007' >His superior way again.</p>

<p class='c007' >“What do you mean, there’s nothing much to
it?” rejoined Sam, a bit peeved.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Not after gliding,” Reed explained, “it’s
rather tame.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“<em>Gliding?</em>” repeated a crowd of interested
fellows. “Where did you ever do gliding?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Where do you suppose?” Reed asked, his
soft eyes burning.</p>

<p class='c007' >Later, through Coach Turner, who had
gained a degree of Reed’s confidence, astounded
Seldon Prep schoolmates learned that this quiet
mannered, self-effacing youth, had won the
Southern States Gliding Contest with a flight of
six hours and fourteen minutes ... and with
a glider he had built himself. Sam Hartley,
when he heard this, spent some uncomfortable
moments running a finger underneath a tight
collar band.</p>

<p class='c007' >“How far has this <em>Softy</em> ski jumped?” he
asked the Coach, finally.</p>

<p class='c007' >Upon this point, however, Coach Turner was
non-communicative.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You’ll find out the day of the meet,” he
said.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007' >Seventeen of an enrollment of two hundred
were entrants in the famed ski jump which was
the event responsible for the big turn-out of
spectators. Seldon Prep was one of the few
northern schools giving attention to ski jumping
and the fact was recognized by news reel camera
men who stationed themselves below the incline
with cameras commanding a range of the landing
area. With ice skating and bob-sled races
out of the way, the course along the ski slide and
beyond it was lined with a colorful winter
crowd. The sky was overcast with just a suggestion
of snow in the air. Newspapers, having
gotten wind of the Southern boy’s participation
in the meet, had advertised Reed Markham as
the “dark horse” so that spectators were discussing
him and trying to pick him out.</p>

<p class='c007' >Seldon’s method of operating the ski jump
was a system of her own. Sam Hartley, as defending
champion, was entitled to jump last.
The other competitors were required to draw
lots for places and a sober-faced Reed winced
as he found that he had drawn number “one.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“So I’ve got to start the meet,” Reed murmured
to himself. “Here’s a tough break right
off.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Remember,” warned Coach Turner, who
was the official in charge, “for distance to be
counted on your jumps, you must land clean, on
your skis, and continue. What happens after
that, of course, is of no consequence. But no
jumps will be recognized if the jumper falls in
landing. Is that clear?”</p>

<p class='c007' >The contestants nodded and looked to their
skis. All were atop the hill which provided a
fine view of the surrounding country ... the
Seldon Prep school buildings and grounds on the
right ... straight ahead and precipitately
down in the valley—the town of Seldon. The
Rapid River separated the town from the school
property. The clearing in which the skiers
were to land was a park on the Seldon Prep end
of the bridge. Skiers completing the jump
successfully would carry on, passing over the
bridge and coming to a stop on the other side
the river. Either that or turn their skis sidewise
and bring up short, risking a tumble into
the banked snow on the sides around the clearing.
To the left, looking from the top of the
hill, was open country. The landscape today
looked particularly attractive since a thin coating
of additional snow had fallen the night before.
The sliding lane was dotted black with
humanity ... the dots merging into a blotter-like
area below where the skiers were to finish.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Suppose you’re all ready to <em>take</em> us?” queried
Sam as he skied over beside Reed who had knelt
to be sure his feet were firmly fastened to the
skis.</p>

<p class='c007' >Reed gave no answer. In truth, his heart
was pounding like mad. He did not dare venture
a comment for fear his voice would quaver.
This thing of demonstrating before a crowd he
felt to be hostile; schoolmates waiting to ridicule,
and in a sport he had attempted to master
within a short, concentrated period, had all
tended to affect Reed’s nerves. Thousands had
watched the glider contest and he had not cared.
But never had he wanted so much to make good ... to
give these swell-headed Northerners a
Southern spanking—where it hurt the worst—in
their own sport.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Each contestant gets three qualifying
jumps,” announced Director Turner. “And
three chances to better the marks of his opponents.
If he fails he, of course, drops out. Are
you ready, Reed Markham?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Yes, sir!” said Reed, and wondered in a
flashing thought, what his father would say
if he could see him now.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Course clear!” came the shout from below
and the small figure of an official, looking up,
waved a green flag at him.</p>

<p class='c007' >Conscious that every eye was on him, the fellow
from down South prepared to take-off. He
surveyed the incline up which he must shoot and
calculated the breeze which was blowing, taking
these factors into account as though he were
about to leave the ground in a glider.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Well, here goes!” he said, and caught his
breath as he whizzed down the slide.</p>

<p class='c007' >A white ribbon of snow passed him with
almost express train speed; he saw a kaleidoscopic
sea of faces, crazily distorted as he shot downward;
heard the excited murmur of the crowd
which broke into a wild “Ah!” as he crouched
and took the air. Below him a rough horseshoe
of humanity, blurred trees, houses, the river ... and
down, down, down ... swooping
low ready for the landing ... he was wavering,
losing his balance ... something wasn’t
quite right....</p>

<p class='c007' >“A great take-off!” breathed champion Sam
Hartley, following the Southerner’s flight.
“But he’s going to crash!... Too bad!...”</p>

<p class='c007' >Striking on one ski, Reed desperately tried to
keep his feet but was catapulted instead, landing
head first in a mound of snow and narrowly
missing a rim of spectators. Willing hands
reached for him and pulled him out, shaken and
gasping.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You all right?” asked the official who had
waved him down.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Yes,” Reed reassured, recovering his skis.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Too bad, kid!” sympathized an onlooker.
“That first jump of yours might have been a
record if you’d kept your feet.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Reed glanced at once at his landing place.
He had come down beyond the hundred foot
mark.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Well,” was his comment, “all I can do is
try again!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“The boy’s got nerve!” somebody nearby remarked.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007' >Champion Sam Hartley’s first jump gave
early evidence of his superb form when he broke
his own record with a leap of one hundred and
eleven feet. He mounted the hill, grinning
jubilantly and eyeing the fellow from down
South who was about to take off on his second
try, as much as to say, “Beat that, if you can,
you <em>beginner</em>!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“He’s good all right,” Reed conceded. “This
gliding through the air and keeping your balance
without wings of any kind is no small trick.
When you land it’s usually harder, too.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Setting himself grimly, Reed leaned forward.</p>

<p class='c007' >“He’s off!” cried the crowd.</p>

<p class='c007' >Hurtling off the incline, body perfectly
poised, the only contestant from the South carried
well over the landing field and came down
as gracefully as a bird. This time there was
no wavering, his return to earth was as
beautifully maneuvered as a pilot’s three point landing.
There followed a mighty cheer from the
crowd!</p>

<p class='c007' >“Holy smoke!” gasped Sam, staring. “I
believe he’s ... yes, sir—that Georgia riddle
has topped my mark. The question is—how
much?”</p>

<p class='c007' >A few seconds later the crowd thrilled at the
megaphoned announcement that Reed Markham,
number one, had been credited with a
jump of one hundred and thirteen feet, six
inches!</p>

<p class='c007' >“Hey, Sam!” kidded Tom Carrow who was
now third with a jump of ninety-eight feet.
“You’ve got your work cut out for you!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Don’t I know it?” Seldon’s champion returned.
“I can’t let that baby beat me. I’d
never hear the last of it—after all the razzing
I’ve handed him.”</p>

<p class='c007' >For the first time since he had come to Seldon
Prep, Reed Markham was supremely happy as,
with the plaudits of the crowd resounding in his
ears, he toiled up the ice-coated hill to the starting
place. Let this Sam Hartley person top this
mark if he could. Now the ski was distinctly
on the other foot! Sam had broken his own
mark and he, Reed, who had taken up skiing but
a month before, had topped that! Pretty good
for a Southern boy who apparently wasn’t considered
much good at all!</p>

<p class='c007' >“Great stuff!” greeted Sam, considerably to
Reed’s surprise. “That’s the greatest jump I
ever saw!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Thanks,” said Reed, and scowled. “What
else can Hartley say?” he asked himself, trying
to explain the champion’s gesture of sportsmanship.
“But I’ll bet those Northerners are really
burning up!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Trying desperately, the defending champion
failed to equal even his previous distance on the
next two jumps. Reed, meanwhile, reserving
his right as the leading jumper, did not take his
turns. And, when each of the other rivals failed
in their third tries to better the mark, Reed felt
his nerves tingling as the fellow he detested
strapped on his skis for his last attempt.</p>

<p class='c007' >“He can’t beat it!” something told Reed.
“I’m going to win! I’m just a novice ... a
rank amateur ... but I’m going to beat this
cocksure Northerner. They will laugh at a
Southerner, will they? This’ll fix ’em, and
maybe I won’t have something to write Dad!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Reed was still exultant as a breathless crowd,
pulling for the local favorite to come through,
cheered mightily with Sam Hartley’s all-important
take-off. Reed followed Sam’s form
as it swept majestically off the incline and sailed
outward over the clearing. His eyes strained
with sudden concern as he noted that Sam had
made a prodigious leap and was coming down
close to his own record distance. Sam struck the
slope, wavered, thrashed his arms violently to
keep his feet, succeeded and continued on down
over the bridge amid a mad tumult.</p>

<p class='c007' >“He did it! He topped that Markham fellow’s
distance!” shouted a spectator. “What
ski jumping! Records being broken right and
left!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Reed felt nervous perspiration ooze out upon
him. Now he had it all to do over again. This
was hair-raising, blood-chilling competition.
Reduced now, just to the two of them, it would
be a bitter fight to the finish ... a battle with
no quarter asked and no quarter given ... between
North and South.</p>

<p class='c007' >A tickled Sam Hartley, accepting congratulatory
pats on the back, stationed himself below
to await his Southern rival’s next jump. He
waved his defiance at the figure on top of the
hill. Reed Markham would have to surpass
one hundred and fifteen feet to take the lead
from the champ.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I guess that finishes him!” Sam said in a
low tone to overjoyed schoolmates. “But, boy—he’s
made me do some tall jumping!”</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007' >Racing down the slide, determined to best
his previous jumps, Reed fairly shot out into
space.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Good night!” exclaimed Sam, face sobering.
“That guy’s a regular kangaroo!...
Hey! Look out, kid!... Look out the way!”</p>

<p class='c007' >It happened quickly—a couple of playful
kids chasing each other across the snow and one
of them directly in the path of the descending
ski jumper. Reed, looking down, saw that his
landing was to be fraught with peril for himself
as well as the youngster. There was only
one thing to do. With complete disregard for
himself he twisted his body in air, hurled himself
forward and, just clearing the startled kid,
struck the ground on the tips of his skis, upended
and rolled and slid for some feet, finally colliding
with a tree, where he lay, stunned.
Even so, the point of his landing was in excess
of the distance Sam had made, indicating that,
had he been able to come to earth without incident,
Sam’s record might once more have been
eclipsed.</p>

<p class='c007' >“How are you, fellow?” asked Sam, the first
one to him, sitting the dazed Reed Markham
up and looking him over, anxiously.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I—I’m all right, I guess. I—I missed the
kid, didn’t I?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Yeah, that scamp’s okay,” Sam reassured.
“That was a nervy thing you just did. Too
bad it had to spoil your jump. You’re too
shaken up. We’d better call this a day. I’m
awfully sorry—really!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Sam helped Reed to his feet. Director
Turner came hurrying up; the crowd commenced
gathering around.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Give me just a minute,” Reed pleaded.
“I’ve got two more jumps coming. I...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“<em>Two</em> more?” exclaimed Sam. “You’ve got
<em>three</em>. We’re not counting that one.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Thanks,” said Reed, and gave the fellow
he detested a questioning glance. These Northerners
were more chivalrous than he had
thought.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You’ve jumped enough,” declared Coach
Turner, taking Reed’s arm. “You’ve done
wonders as it is....”</p>

<p class='c007' >“No!” insisted Reed, his soft eyes taking on
a look of grim determination. “Whenever a
fellow crashes, he’s got to go up and take-off
again. That’s an old glider rule. I’m all
right. Make way for me, will you please?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Well, I’ll be dogged!” cried Sam, in sheer
admiration, as the fellow he had pestered
brought an ovation from the crowd by starting
the long climb up the hill.</p>

<p class='c007' >“A Markham never quits!” Reed was repeating
to himself as he went toward the top.</p>

<p class='c007' >And he was repeating it after he had failed
in two more jumps, the first of which resulted
in another tumble and the second falling short
by half a foot.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You’ve still another jump if you feel like
it!” Sam offered.</p>

<p class='c007' >“No,” said Reed, extending his hand in
token of surrender. “You win!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ll never feel quite right about this,” said
Sam, as he gripped the hand of the fellow he
had dubbed “Softy.” “You’re some guy, Reed!
You made me break my own record twice to
top you. I’m sorry it’s taken us fellows so long
to get to know you ... but I’m glad of one
thing...!” He paused, grinning.</p>

<p class='c007' >“What’s that?” asked Reed, feeling his heart
suddenly go out to this Northern foeman.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m glad,” said Sam, “that you didn’t have
snow in Georgia! Man—a guy who can jump
like you did in a month’s time...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Coldness—imaginary and otherwise—vanished
quickly after that as fellow schoolmates
gathered around for the privilege of shaking
the Southerner by the hand ... and, as if to
prove that the Northern warmth was to remain—the
next day brought a heavy thaw!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='story5' class='c009'>IN WRONG RIGHT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006' >They picked me to do the dirty work because
I was a special friend of Eddie Summers and
they didn’t think he’d suspect me.</p>

<p class='c007' >Eddie was the leader of the freshest bunch
of Freshies that ever got fresh at Lillard High.
He’d made things miserable for us Sophs all
year and the worst thing about it, he’d slipped
out of every trap we’d set for him. The other
Freshies didn’t cut so much bait with us. Eddie
was the rudder to the Freshman ship ... and
once we put the rudder out of commission we
knew the first year boat would flounder like a
fish trying to make a cross country hike.</p>

<p class='c007' >Pete Dean, leader of our forces, had prided
himself on being a commander-in-chief second
only to General Pershing and a few other
notables not worth mentioning. To have an
insignificant mortal, wearing the green skull
cap insignia of the Freshman ranks, consistently
outwit and thwart his best laid plans for keeping
the first year fellows in their places, was
only to add fuel to the day when the Sophs
should drive through to a high and mighty revenge.</p>

<p class='c007' >“He can’t get away with it every time,”
Pete insisted, the morning after we saw the
Freshman colors of green and white rippling
in the breeze from the reed-like flag-staff on
top of the Lillard High belfry.</p>

<p class='c007' >“But who’s going up and get those colors
down?” I asked, not caring to volunteer for
reasons plainly obvious!</p>

<p class='c007' >“If anyone’ll tell me how that human fly
climbed up there and tied those colors to the
top of that flag pole without breaking his neck
and dislocating both ears ... I’ll get it down!”
exploded Pete.</p>

<p class='c007' >But he knew blamed well that nobody could
tell him! And anyhow, when Principal Sawyer
spotted those colors he posted a notice on the
bulletin board saying that he’d expel anyone
who tried to take ’em down.</p>

<p class='c007' >Obadiah Erasmus Tucker got hot under the
collar, too. The idea of any lower classman
cutting such capers! As president of the
Student Government League he felt called upon
to declare himself against all stunts and hazing.
Obadiah was a Senior now and he’d never gotten
over the humiliation of having to wear a green
cap his Freshman year.</p>

<p class='c007' >I wish you could have seen Obadiah. He
was the personification of dignity plus. No
wonder they elected him president of the United
Classes of Lillard. He never did anything improper.
He was a polished example of law
and order. And how he loved to enforce regulations!
Obadiah looked upon “his truly” as
the exalted head of a school court for the promotion
of inter-class peace. The Seniors held
the balance of power in this funny government
which Obadiah had helped to form, because
the Seniors were supposed to be the most experienced.
The other classes were represented
according to their place in the scheme of things.
Real important decisions had to have the endorsement
of the faculty but we got a lot of
fun out of thinking that we governed ourselves
anyway.</p>

<p class='c007' >I guess a person has to have dignity to be
looked up to ... or else they must be tall.
Obadiah was both. He was the tallest fellow
in school besides holding his head the highest.
Eddie Summers was the only one who could
come near him for altitude. Obadiah looked
like a piece of pulled taffy. Everything about
him was long. He had a long face, a long nose,
a long neck, long arms and longer legs. Maybe
that’s why it was so hard for him to unbend ...
lots of longitude but hardly any latitude. His
face was so long that he couldn’t laugh with
it. Nothing ever seemed to strike him funny.
I’ll bet you couldn’t have tickled him if you’d
teased the bottoms of his feet with a straw.
And if you laughed at anything yourself he
acted like you’d violated half the constitution
which called for a respectful attitude at all
times.</p>

<p class='c007' >Honest, Obadiah had us thinking he was a
Swiss cheese and we didn’t amount to anything
but the holes. He was very important and
superior. I guess now it was because he wore
double-lensed, shell-rimmed glasses and his
hair always stuck up straight on his head. The
glasses used to use his nose as a toboggan slide
and he was always taking a long finger and
shoving them back up where they belonged.
He had just about as much trouble with his
pants. Every time he sat down he pulled up
about a yard of the legs so’s he wouldn’t stretch
the creases out of the knees.</p>

<p class='c007' >But I started to tell you about the Freshies
and the sweet little job I was picked to handle.
You can imagine how good the Freshies felt
at getting their colors up to stay. And you
won’t have to twist your imagination out of
shape to figure what an eyesore those colors were
to us, being the first thing we saw coming to
school and the last on going home, as the belfry
could be seen several blocks away!</p>

<p class='c007' >The oldest landmark about Lillard High was
the watering trough. It stood between the
sidewalk and the road, just off the campus on
James street. There weren’t many horses left
in Lillard to use the trough but the water was
artesian and many folks used to get it to drink.
The town had run a pipe up on the outside of
the trough next to the sidewalk where folks
could wet their whistles. The trough was about
ten feet long, three feet wide and four feet
high, made of concrete. There were steps
leading up to the fountain from the sidewalk.
The basin of the trough was about thirty inches
deep and covered with specimens of moss which
the botany professor said was full of Amœbæ.</p>

<p class='c007' >It had been the history of Lillard High that
when any fellow got too fresh he somehow got
acquainted with the watering trough. The
water, coming from a well, was about as cold
as water could be. One plunge in the trough
was usually enough to shrink swelled heads or
cool anyone’s ambition.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I can’t help it if it is mid-winter,” declared
Pete Dean at a special called meeting of the
Sophs, “We’ve got to put a stop to Freshy rule.
It’s the trough for Eddie Summers...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“A guy with that name ought not to mind
the winter,” remarked one of our class wits,
which was me.</p>

<p class='c007' >“That being the case, you’re elected to assist
in the dousing program,” delegated Pete.</p>

<p class='c007' >“No fair! Just because I live next to that
bird’s no sign....”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Oh, come on! You know him better’n we
do. You’ve gone around together. It ’ud be
a cinch to....”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Well, what’s your plan?” I asked, coming
to the point. I was just as anxious to see Eddie
hit the trough as anyone else. He might have
been a friend of mine but class strife was class
strife!</p>

<p class='c007' >“My plan’s this,” outlined Pete. “Obadiah’s
laid down some pretty strict rules and we can’t
afford to get caught, so we’ve got to get Eddie
alone when there’s no one to see us or help him
out. The best time’s after dark ... say, tomorrow
night ... and the only way to do it is
for Ralph here (pointing at me) to find some
excuse for going out with Eddie and lead him
by this trough. We’ll be hiding and we’ll
pounce upon him so quick he’ll be in the icy
deep before he knows what’s hit him!”</p>

<p class='c007' >The fellows liked the idea fine ... all except
me. I’d a lot rather have been one of the
dousers because it wasn’t likely Eddie would
be able to figure out who they were. But I
was sure to catch it in the neck as soon as the
Freshies heard about it.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Here’s your chance to be the class martyr,”
offered Pete. “I only wish I was in your
shoes!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“So do we!” chimed in the other fellows
with all sorts of enthusiasm since they knew
they couldn’t be.</p>

<p class='c007' >There was no use trying to crawl out of it.
I was the unanimous choice and according to
Roberts’ rules of order my say didn’t count.
The next thing was to hit upon a scheme for
luring Eddie out of the house to the scene of
his Waterloo. We’d occasionally gone to the
movies together and it struck the bunch as a
logical idea for me to date Eddie up. Doug
Fairbanks was opening at the Grand theatre
in “Robin Hood” and Eddie would be crazy
to see that because he had always imagined he
resembled Doug. The only resemblance I could
see was that Doug and Eddie both belonged to
the human race ... but we won’t argue about
that.</p>

<p class='c007' >Well ... when I asked Eddie if he’d like
to go, at noon-hour the next day, he hesitated
a few moments as if thinking, then said, appreciative
like, “Don’t care if I do!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Good! I’ll call for you at the house at
seven-thirty tonight,” I replied, my heart
pounding sort of funny.</p>

<p class='c007' >That afternoon word was passed around
among the Sophs that the ducking was going
to be pulled off as per schedule. James street
was the shortest way down town. We lived
half a block off James street on Adams street
and it was a sure bet that we’d take the one
and only route down past the watering trough
on our walk to the Grand theatre.</p>

<p class='c007' >It was cold enough to wear an overcoat when
I set out from the house that night. I almost
thought I was going to lose my nerve ... it
seemed like such a shame—taking advantage
of poor, innocent Eddie that way. And it made
me “B-r-r-r!” to think of the sensation he’d
have when he flopped into that liquid refrigerator.
I remembered the time when a
bunch of us fellows thought we’d imitate polar
bears and jumped in the bay through a hole in
the ice. Never again!</p>

<p class='c007' >It was a dark night, too. This would be
in our favor. The campus was shaded by huge
pine trees and the watering trough was in the
middle of the block so that the light from the
arcs on either corner just barely reached.
Without the moon it was almost pitch dark
through that stretch.</p>

<p class='c007' >I rang Eddie’s door bell ... feeling more
and more like handing in my resignation but
what could I do now? After a few minutes
Eddie came to the door but I saw through the
glass that he didn’t have his hat or coat on.
His face looked grave.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Sorry, Ralph,” Eddie announced. “There’s
sickness in the family and I’ll just have to call
it off tonight. I’m sorry I couldn’t let you know
sooner ... but I kept thinking I could get
away until the last minute.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Oh—that’s all right,” I said, feeling disappointed
and relieved at the same time. “I hope
it’s nothing serious?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“No ... I guess not....” Eddie answered,
not mentioning who was sick. “It’s
only serious for the time being.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Well,—here was a nice howdy do! After
leaving Eddie I stopped outside his house,
wondering what move to make next. The fellows
would be expecting me to show up with
him any minute now. I’d better go down and
tell the boys it was all off ... and explain just
why so’s I wouldn’t get the blame for not going
through with my part in the proceedings.</p>

<p class='c007' >Obadiah Erasmus Tucker lived the second
house from the corner off the intersection of
James and Adams streets, just a block from the
school. Of course it had to be my luck to run
into him as I passed the house. He was on his
way down to the Chamber of Commerce to attend
a civic meeting that he wanted to write up
for a civics lesson.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Why, good evening, Ralph!” Obadiah said
to me. He had an old way about him that
made you feel like he was doing you a favor
to speak to you. “Snappy weather, eh what?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Yes,—pretty lively,” I replied, feeling uneasy
as Obadiah hit it off alongside me. I was
thinking of his running into the fellows at the
trough and that he’d know right away we were
up to some devilment and have us called on
the carpet the next day or report us to the
principal.</p>

<p class='c007' >I shifted over to the side nearest the trough
so I could give the fellows the high sign at the
first opportunity but when we got up close there
wasn’t a one in sight and I began to think
they’d gotten wise and skidooed when all of a
sudden there was a noise like the radio report
of the democratic convention ... only worse
... and black forms swooped around from the
street side of the trough and from behind every
nearby tree.</p>

<p class='c007' >For a second I couldn’t figure out what it
was all about ... until I heard Obadiah give
a yell ... and the next thing I knew there
was a flock of arms hoisting him in the air ...
and before I could shout or do a thing ... Plop!
he went, right into the middle of the watering trough!</p>

<p class='c007' >There was the grandest splashing and sputtering
you ever heard for the next few seconds.
The air seemed full of Obadiah’s arms and
legs. He kicked hard enough to send him most
half way across the English channel but he
couldn’t make any headway in the watering
trough except down.</p>

<p class='c007' >Every time Obadiah’s head came to the top,
Pete Dean, who was standing on the steps,
shoved it under again, yelling, “Souse him good,
fellows! He needs it!”</p>

<p class='c007' >They were making such a commotion,
splashing his dignitary up and down, that it
was all I could do to make myself heard. I
rushed up to Pete, grabbed him by the arm and
hollered in his ear, “Cheese it, you big boob!
It’s Obadiah!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Just then one of the fellows caught sight of
Obadiah’s double-lensed goggles which had
sloshed over the side of the trough and he let
out a whoop like he was shot in ten places
at once.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Great razzberries!” exclaimed Pete, his
eyes sticking out of his head. “Beat it, guys!”</p>

<p class='c007' >The fellows didn’t wait to help Obadiah
out ... they just jerked him to a sitting
position in the trough and left him sputtering and
gasping and blowing water like the cross between
a garden spray and a whale with two spouts.</p>

<p class='c007' >I was too stunned to move ... and when
I did begin to think of locomotion I heard some
new noises around me and saw some other black
forms come dashing across the alley. Then it
dawned on me like a flash. Eddie had outwitted
us again. He’d seen through my invitation
somehow. He’d tipped off the Freshies and
they had waited, in hiding, figuring on catching
us Sophs flat-footed at the trough. But they’d
not counted on unforeseen circumstances any
more than we had ... so they were a little
late in arriving.</p>

<p class='c007' >Right here’s one time where I used my head
for something besides growing a hair on. I
didn’t have a second to lose. The Freshies
were almost on me. I gritted my teeth and
ran up the steps and plunged into the watering
trough beside Obadiah.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007' >Cold? Oh, boy! Cold? The minute I hit
the water it felt like my backbone was one long
icicle ... and when I rolled over and sat up I
thought I had about a hundred sets of teeth.
Poor old Obadiah! He hardly seemed to know
what was going on except that he was holding
down half the country of Greenland and had
a chunk of the North pole in one hand.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Now we’ve got you!” someone cried, close
to my ear.</p>

<p class='c007' >Hands reached in and grabbed Obadiah and
me, dragging us out of the trough like a couple
of wet meal bags. Obadiah was as limp as a
wet bathing suit. His arms and legs were all
tangled up and he was doubled into a knot so’s
not to expose any more of his anatomy than he
could help. I wasn’t exactly comfortable myself.
If it hadn’t been so dark I’ll bet you could
have seen steam coming off our clothes.</p>

<p class='c007' >Eddie was the first one I saw when I got out.
He gave me a triumphant laugh.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Thought you’d put it over on me, didn’t
you?” he taunted. “No one sick at our house
but the cat!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“You’ll be sick in a minute,” I assured him,
getting a strangle hold on my teeth.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Who’s this bird?” a Freshie asked, stooping
over Obadiah who was trying to persuade his
knees to hold him up.</p>

<p class='c007' >Say—when the fellows saw who it was I
thought they’d drop dead where they stood.
They were the scaredest bunch I ever looked at.</p>

<p class='c007' >Obadiah couldn’t talk yet but his eyes
weren’t frozen shut. He was using ’em to spot
every boy in the crowd. A cat didn’t have anything
on Obadiah the way he saw in the dark.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Why—why Mr. Tucker ... what are you
doing here?” asked Eddie, in a voice that shook
worse than mine.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Th-th-that’s wh-wh-what I w-w-want to
know!” stuttered Obadiah, having an awful
time keeping from biting his tongue. “A-A-And
I’m g-g-going to f-f-find out!”</p>

<p class='c007' >This declaration was what I’d been waiting
for. I stepped over where Obadiah could see
me.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I guess they thought you were one of the
Sophomores, too,” I said, putting over my
thunderbolt.</p>

<p class='c007' >I could hear the Freshies gasp. But what
could they say? All they could do was to break
out with nervous perspiration.</p>

<p class='c007' >It was the first time that the president of the
Student Government League had taken any
notice of dripping me!</p>

<p class='c007' >“Wh-wh-what! D-d-did they th-th-throw
y-y-you in, too?” he stammered. “W-w-well,
up-up-upon m-m-my w-word! I’ll m-m-make
th-th-them p-p-pay for th-th-this!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Here’s where Eddie Summers came up for
air.</p>

<p class='c007' >“The Freshies didn’t do it, Mr. Tucker! It
was the Sophs ... they....” he started to
explain.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Y-y-you c-c-can’t t-t-tell me th-th-that! I
know a-a-all about it! And besides ... I-I’m
p-p-pretty n-n-near frozen t-to d-d-death. I-I’ll
attend to y-y-you f-f-fellows in the m-m-morning.
Th-th-there’ll be a s-s-special meeting
of the League t-t-to t-t-take up your cases.
R-R-Ralph, h-h-hadn’t y-y-you b-b-better c-c-come
over t-t-to my h-h-house wh-wh-while
I g-g-get a doctor?”</p>

<p class='c007' >Obadiah’s teeth were making a sound like a
freight train clattering over a cattle guard at
a railroad crossing. He was getting worse right
along. Eddie did have presence enough of mind
to offer to help him home.</p>

<p class='c007' >“H-h-help m-m-me h-h-home?” Obadiah
glowered, “S-s-such imp-p-p-pert-t-tinence!”
He shook a shaky fist at the leader of the
subdued Freshies. “G-g-get along with you, b-b-before
I l-l-lose m-m-my t-t-temper!”</p>

<p class='c007' >The boys backed off, kind of bewildered like
... as if they didn’t know just what would be
the proper caper,—but when they got a little
ways off they broke into a run and scattered
mighty quick.</p>

<p class='c007' >I picked up Obadiah’s glasses and he stood
for a minute with his knees leaning together,
trying to put them on ... but his hands shook
so hard that he couldn’t locate his nose. He
finally gave up trying and took a couple of steps
toward home ... peering around like he was
afraid some distinguished citizen of Lillard
would pass by and see him in his undisguised
state. But the coast was clear.</p>

<p class='c007' >Obadiah didn’t object when I took hold of
his arm. Our clothes sounded crinkly and
crackly like as we walked ... but somehow I
was a lot warmer than I had been. And I was
just getting to the place where I could begin
to see how funny everything was. When we
got to the corner I couldn’t hold it in any longer.
I busted right out laughing.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Wh-what’s the m-m-matter?” asked Obadiah,
alarmed.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Something tickles me,” I said, laughing
some more as I helped him up his front steps.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Y-y-you’re h-h-hysterical ... th-th-that’s
what’s the m-m-matter,” he said, getting excited,
“Y-y-your condition’s s-s-serious!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Nothing must do but that I come in while
his mother calls the doctor and my folks and
runs around like a Japanese coolie laying out dry
clothes for both of us and pouring hot water in
the tub.</p>

<p class='c007' >When I saw the outfit Mrs. Tucker had put
out for me to wear I had another fit of laughing
which Obadiah thought would send me into
convulsions.</p>

<p class='c007' >A suit of flannel underwear with the shirt
and drawers separate; an old pair of long pants,
which Mrs. Tucker said would warm my legs
up; and a cast-off smoking jacket which had
belonged to Mr. Tucker before he got a new
one last Christmas—that hung around me like
a lean-to tent. Maybe I didn’t look like the
cat’s moustache!</p>

<p class='c007' >Well—the doctor finally got there and after
examining Obadiah he advised a brisk rubbing
and plenty of hot drinks and hot water bottles
... but said he didn’t think there’d be any ill
effects as the victim had stood the shock better
than the victim had expected.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I wish you’d look after poor Ralph. He’s
propped up in the chair out there,” I heard
Obadiah say in a disappointed voice. “I think
he’s even worse off than I am!”</p>

<p class='c007' >The doc came out and gave me the once over.
He looked as though he couldn’t believe his
eyes. I was sitting with my legs stuck out over
another chair so that the ends of the trousers
hung empty like I didn’t have any feet. I didn’t
have any arms either ... and the sleeves to the
coat hung like they do from a hanger. Then
there was nothing under my coat but the underwear
which fitted around my neck as loose as a
horse collar.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m suffering from a complication of
clothes,” I whispered to the doc ... and then
there was two of us laughing instead of one.</p>

<p class='c007' >Obadiah sent his mother in to see what was
up. And at the same time my folks arrived
with some of my own clothes.</p>

<p class='c007' >“The boy’s all right,” said the doc, after he
got his second wind. “All he needed was a good
laugh ... and I’ve just finished giving it to
him!”</p>

<p class='c007' >He winked at me as he went out the door.</p>

<p class='c007' >I didn’t get a chance to see the other fellows
till school commenced next day and then it was
too late to explain what had happened. There
was an air of direful expectancy among the
Sophs ... and the Freshies moved about in fear
and trembling.</p>

<p class='c007' >Sure enough! The bell rang for a special
session of chapel the very first thing. We shuffled
into the assembly room ... most of the
school wondering what it was all about. Principal
Sawyer was on the platform with the
president of the United Classes of Lillard. It
was evident right off the bat that the meeting
had not been called for entertainment
purposes.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Everyone but the Freshman and Sophomore
boys is excused from this chapel to attend regular
classes,” said the principal.</p>

<p class='c007' >There was a murmur of curiosity and a lot of
confusion as the room was cleared and the fellows
who were left, gathered in two bunches up
toward the front.</p>

<p class='c007' >When things had quieted down so that every
fellow was having a good time listening to his
heart skip beats, Obadiah got up at a nod from
Principal Sawyer and walked to the edge of the
platform, glaring down at us.</p>

<p class='c007' >Honest—I felt like snickering again! All
the kink was out of his stand-up hair and he
looked like he’d shrunk two good inches. He
reminded me of a drooping water lily ... but
mad? Say, he was the living embodiment
of all the righteous indignation in the
world!</p>

<p class='c007' >“There has come to the attention of the Student
Government League a very grave case of
hazing,” Obadiah started. “A case which,
I regret to say (which he didn’t) must be
dealt with severely. It concerns the ducking
of a Sophomore in the ... in the watering
trough...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >The Sophs glanced in my direction in dumbfounded
surprise. The Freshies looked glum.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Such an offense is bad enough in warm
weather,” Obadiah continued, “but in mid-winter,
(he shuddered) it is absolutely and positively
criminal!”</p>

<p class='c007' >I felt like saying “Amen!” to that. Obadiah
stopped to clear his throat and to tap himself
on the chest like he was afraid he was going to
get a cold on his lungs.</p>

<p class='c007' >“As you all know, the League has the first
power to act on matters relating to the willful
misconduct of students,” said Obadiah, as if
he’d memorized what he was going to say. “At
a meeting of the Emergency Committee this
morning it was decided that, if strict measures
are necessary to prevent further ... er ...
further violence ... the League is prepared to
take them!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Obadiah’s hair began to stand on end like a
porcupine’s quills. I could tell he was getting
ready to shoot a broadside. So could everyone.
But no one could tell where he was going to hit.</p>

<p class='c007' >“The Freshman class this year has been a
trouble breeder. Even the Freshman representative
admits that....”</p>

<p class='c007' >Time out while the Sophs all heaved a big
sigh of relief!</p>

<p class='c007' >“... and it is my understanding that this
activity has largely been due to one member
who, I have reason to know, was especially
prominent in last night’s doings...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >All eyes went to Eddie who sat looking like
there was sickness in the family and he was <em>it</em>.
I just had to smile when I thought of the turn
things had taken. But the smile came off the
very next minute.</p>

<p class='c007' >“It therefore pains me to report that, in consideration
of past offenses and because of his
continued disregard for regulations or authority,
the Student Government League respectfully
recommends to the faculty and Principal
Sawyer that Mr. Edward Summers be expelled
from Lillard High School!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Obadiah laid a long hand against his long
face and waited to observe the effect of this
recommendation upon those present in the
assembly room.</p>

<p class='c007' >We were stunned all right. I really hadn’t
thought Obadiah would go that far. I didn’t
want to see Eddie get put out of school. It
was easy for anyone to tell that Obadiah was
trying to get around a bad situation by making
an example of Eddie. But what worried me
most was that Principal Sawyer looked like he
was going to back up the recommend!</p>

<p class='c007' >There wasn’t a sound for about two good
breaths, when suddenly Eddie jumped to his
feet, eyes gleaming.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Excuse me, sir. It was the Sophs who
ducked you!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Have you ever been some place during a storm
when the air all at once seemed full of electricity?
Well, you’ll know how we felt then—our
skin prickled!</p>

<p class='c007' >Obadiah gave Eddie a look like he didn’t
have any use for a fellow who would try to
shift the blame.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Prove it!” he challenged.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I can’t,” said Eddie, and sat down again.</p>

<p class='c007' >Obadiah smiled soberly. You’d have to see
him do it to appreciate how anyone could smile
soberly. He was sure Eddie had been trying to
spoof him.</p>

<p class='c007' >I couldn’t stay out of the rumpus any longer.
It had gotten beyond a class proposition now.
So up I bolted.</p>

<p class='c007' >“If he can’t prove it ... I can!” I said, in
a loud voice.</p>

<p class='c007' >Suffering fireworks, what a commotion!
The fellows almost fell out of their seats.
Obadiah gaped at me, mouth open clear to his
wisdom teeth. Principal Sawyer jumped to his
feet and came to the front of the platform.</p>

<p class='c007' >Pete Dean, sitting right behind me, just about
yanked my coat tails off.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Shut up, you poor fish!” he whispered.
“Want to get us all in dutch?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m going to speak the truth and nothing
but the truth!” I said, determined to make a
clean breast of everything. The Freshies acted
as if they were going to applaud but the Sophs
looked like they were going to use their hands
for some other purpose as soon as convenient.</p>

<p class='c007' >“If you can shed any light on this unfortunate
happening we should be glad to hear from
you,” invited Principal Sawyer.</p>

<p class='c007' >Obadiah didn’t appear so enthusiastic.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I can shed all the light there is to be shed,”
I replied, diplomatic-like, “but I want to know
first ... if I prove Eddie’s not guilty ... will
you reinstate him?... I mean, put him back
in school?”</p>

<p class='c007' >The principal of Lillard High looked at the
president of the United Classes of Lillard and
the president looked at the principal. They
shook their heads “yes.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“All right!” Then I explained the whole
business—how we Sophs had planned to duck
Eddie; how I was elected to call at his house
and walk him past the trough; how Eddie got
wise to our game and tipped off the Freshies
who waited in the alley to waylay us; how I
ran into Obadiah as I was going down to the
trough to tell the fellows the plan fell through;
how, in the darkness, the fellows mistook the
head of the Student Government League for
Eddie and flopped him in the trough before I
could think of Jack Robinson, much less say
it,—and how I jumped in when the Freshies
came running up, to make it look like they’d
ducked Obadiah and me.</p>

<p class='c007' >“So if there’s any expelling to be done—you’d
better begin on us,” I concluded.</p>

<p class='c007' >It was so still for a few minutes that you
could have heard a handkerchief drop. Obadiah
looked like he’d been deprived of the opportunity
of a life time. He and the principal went
into a conference and they talked a long while
... so long that we all got restless and began
to scrape our feet around on the floor.</p>

<p class='c007' >At last Principal Sawyer stepped forward
and Obadiah sank down in a chair, crestfallen.</p>

<p class='c007' >There was a twinkle in the principal’s eyes
as he started to speak. I believe he’d have
laughed outright—now that he had the straight
of things—if he hadn’t had lots of self control.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Thanks to Ralph Duncan’s explanation the
recommended action against Edward Summers
has been withdrawn....”</p>

<p class='c007' >The boys started to cheer ... they just
couldn’t help it ... but the principal raised his
hand.</p>

<p class='c007' >“However, you are all placed on probation
for the rest of the term,” he said, which didn’t
sound so good. “Let this be a lesson to you. Report
to your next hour classes!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“You’re a swell class martyr, you are!” reproved
Pete, as we left the room. “Tie the
Freshies up in a bow knot last night and untie
them this morning!”</p>

<p class='c007' >There wasn’t anything I could say to that
... so I kept mum.</p>

<p class='c007' >But the next morning, when Pete and I came
to school, I happened to look up at the belfry.</p>

<p class='c007' >Holy smoke! The Freshman colors were
gone!</p>

<p class='c007' >Pete beat me to expressing what popped into
our heads at the same time.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Eddie Summers ... the nervy cuss ...
risked his fool neck to dip his colors to us.
Well, I’d like to see him get expelled for that!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='story6' class='c009'>THE SKI POLICE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006' >Snow started falling in Centerville on Friday
night and continued with the aid of a forty
mile gale until late Monday. “A regular old-fashioned
blizzard,” old settlers declared, as
telephone lines were swept down and roads
made impassable. For the first time in years
schools were closed and inhabitants set themselves
to the prodigious task of digging out.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Greatest weather in the world for skiing!”
Bill Stewart announced gleefully to his two
chums.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Yes,” said Phil Black, grinning, “with
snow ten and fifteen feet deep in spots. If you
ever fall off your skis, you’re apt to disappear
for good!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Snowshoes would really be the thing,” replied
Max, “but there’s seldom such a snow
as this. I doubt if there’s a couple pair of snowshoes
in all Centerville.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Skis will be okay if we’re careful,” urged
Bill. “I’d like to ski up to our shack on Mountain
Ridge. What do you say?”</p>

<p class='c007' >The two chums looked at one another consultingly.
The hill that was known as Mountain
Ridge could be seen to the west. It towered
majestically among the lesser hills which
bounded the valley in which Centerville reposed.</p>

<p class='c007' >“We might make an all day outing of it,”
considered Max. “Take our packs and lunch
and eat in the shack. Too bad we can’t just
cut across country and save a couple miles but
the climbing’s too steep. There’ll be some
great natural slides coming back. I’m game
to go. How about you, Phil?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Majority rules,” smiled Phil. “Count me
in. When do we start?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“How’s ten o’clock tomorrow morning?”
Bill proposed.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Suits us,” Phil and Max responded.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007' >The woods after the great snow were a gorgeous
sight. Fir trees plastered white; bare trees
coated limb for limb; shrubbery weighted down
and all but the highest buried from view; hillsides
lost in a glossy expanse; tips of telephone
poles all that could be seen in drifted sections;
occasionally a glimpse of old Mother Earth in
windswept areas; everything in the crisp out-of-doors
bearing mute or glowing testimony of
the storm’s handiwork.</p>

<p class='c007' >Reaching the top of Mountain Ridge after
a leisurely trip of three hours, the chums gazed
about in spellbound admiration of the spectacle.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Never saw anything like this!” Max exclaimed,
finally. “It gives me the feeling of
being somewhere that no one else has been before
... as though we’re members of an exploring
party. Look—our ski tracks are the
only sign of any humans about. No one has
broken a trail up through here since Thursday!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Naturally not,” said Bill. “This is a little
used road we’re standing on anyway. It probably
won’t be cleared for several weeks yet.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Yes, but the main road was the same,” reminded
Phil. “There weren’t any tracks a mile
after we left town.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I guess you’re right,” Bill was forced to
admit. “Well, then—we <em>are</em> alone! Pioneers,
you might say ... blizzard trail blazers!”</p>

<p class='c007' >The three chums laughed, directing their
glances toward the town of Centerville, a black
and white patch three miles below them.
Their shack commanded an even better view,
located as it was upon a ledge just beneath the
brow of Mountain Ridge.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Let’s get on to the shack,” urged Bill. “I’m
cold. We could stand a good fire in that makeshift
fireplace of ours.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Hold on!” cried Max, excitedly. “Did
you say a minute ago that we were standing on
the road?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Well, I should have said we were standing
some eight feet above the road,” corrected Bill,
“the snow’s sure filled in this bank here.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ll say it has!” Max rejoined, scraping
with his ski across a blackened surface, “and it’s
completely covered an automobile!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“<em>What?</em>”</p>

<p class='c007' >Unbelievingly, the two chums knelt down
beside Max and felt with their hands.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Good grief!” cried Phil. “We’re actually
standing on the top!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Say—maybe this party got lost in the storm
and froze to death in the car!” suggested Bill.</p>

<p class='c007' >It was an unpleasant thought. Each chum
felt his spine tingle uncomfortably.</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’d better dig down and investigate,” decided
Max. “Good thing I brought this collapsible
snow shovel along!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Unslinging the shovel, Max straightened out
the handle and snapped it in place.</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’ll take turns,” prompted Bill. “Boy,
what do you know about this? Talk about a
thrill!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“It’s a sedan,” Max announced, a few minutes
later. “Whew! Take the shovel, Phil!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Quickly uncovering one side, the boys soon
found themselves standing on the running
board and scraping the snow from the ice-glazed
windows.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I almost hate to look in,” said Max. “It
gives me the creeps.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Got to do it,” insisted Bill, and pressed his
nose against the glass opposite the driver’s seat.
“Pretty hard to see anything. The snow on
the other side makes it dark in here. Pass us
your flashlight, Phil.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Here you are!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Max and Phil awaited Bill’s findings.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Huh!” he grunted, finally. “It’s abandoned!
Funny place to leave a car. There’s not
a decent shelter within several miles of this spot.
I wouldn’t be surprised if, when the snow disappears,
some bodies will be found on old
Mountain Ridge.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’d better uncover the license number so
we can report it when we get back to town,”
suggested Max.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Good idea!” approved Bill.</p>

<p class='c007' >“It’s M-617-503,” Phil announced, after
more digging and kicking the crusted snow off
the plate. “Better make a note of it.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“That’s what I’m doing,” said Max, producing
pencil and paper. “I’ll bet this wasn’t the
only car that was stalled by the storm and has
been buried in drifts. We’ll probably hear of
plenty of others when we get news from outside.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Yeah,” grinned Bill, “the farmers are probably
entertaining a lot of stranded tourists
along the main roads. Well, I’m glad we didn’t
find anybody in the car. It would have sort of
put a damper on our outing.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“You said it,” agreed Phil. “Well, the
sooner we hit the shack now, the better I’ll like
it. I’m chilled through myself.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Arrived at the highest point on the ridge,
the chums gazed down upon the ledge below
which supported their shack. This ledge sloped
off steeply as the hill descended into the valley
with several smaller hills serving to diminish
the sharp decline. The hillside was sparsely
covered with trees and underbrush and presented
a picturesque sight at the moment.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Look!” cried Phil. “The snow’s cleared
away in front of our shack ... and there’s
smoke coming out the chimney!”</p>

<p class='c007' >The discovery left the two chums temporarily
spellbound.</p>

<p class='c007' >“It’s the automobile party without a doubt!”
Bill gasped, finally. “They’ve found our shack
and they’ve been snowed in. Lucky thing for
them they could get under cover!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“They must have about burned up our wood
supply by now,” ruminated Max.</p>

<p class='c007' >“And I’ll be surprised if they’re not close to
starving,” added Phil. “Let’s go around and
down to the ledge. Careful your skis don’t get
away with you ... this is dangerous business
along here.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Edging down with great caution, the three
chums skied onto the ledge and breathlessly approached
the door of their shack which had
been freed of snow as well as one window.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Maybe they won’t be glad to be reached by
someone!” whispered Max. “Shall I rap,
Bill?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Sure,” grinned Bill, “it’s our shack but it’s
occupied, so we’re just visitors.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Max lifted his hand and tapped lightly on
the door with the backs of his knuckles. There
was an immediate stir inside and muffled voices.
The chums glanced at each other questioningly
as the door opened a crack and the gaunt figure
of a man was disclosed who covered them with
a revolver. When the stranger saw who it was,
he gave vent to a hollow laugh and lowered the
weapon.</p>

<p class='c007' >“It’s just three kids,” he said to evident companions
behind him. “Hello, boys—how the
devil did you find this place?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“It happens to be our shack,” replied Bill,
nudging Phil and Max, warningly.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Oh, ho! It does, eh?” said the man, eyeing
them shrewdly and opening the door that his
two roughly dressed comrades could see the
visitors. “Well, we’re much obliged for a hideaway
out of the storm!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“You said it!” echoed the short, stocky man,
bluntly.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Been skiing, eh?” observed the third of the
trio, a dark-skinned, dark-eyed individual. “I
wondered how you got up here. Road open
yet?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Everything’s closed,” Phil reported.
“Worst storm in history. Don’t look like
things would be really cleared for three or four
days yet.”</p>

<p class='c007' >The men were seen to be exchanging meaningful glances.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Come in, boys!” invited the man who had
opened the door. “Sorry we have to mess your
place up.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“We no can help,” apologized the stubby
stranger.</p>

<p class='c007' >“That’s all right,” assured Bill, warily.
“We won’t come in, thanks. We just thought
we’d have a look at the shack to see if it was
okay before we went back to town.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“You didn’t happen to bring any food with
you, did you?” asked the first man.</p>

<p class='c007' >“N-no,” Bill started.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Yes, we did!” Phil piped up, and went into
his knapsack, taking out a tissue-papered package,
which he tossed to the man. “Here you
are.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Ravenously, the stranger tore the paper from
the sandwiches and divided the food between
his two companions.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Thanks, Buddy!” he cried, amid a mouthful.
“That just about saves our lives!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“You goof!” whispered Bill, as the men attacked
the food. “These birds are robbers!
See those money bags in the corner?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Sure,” returned Phil. “I just did that to
give us a chance to beat it. Come on—right
down over the hillside!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Taking advantage of the trio’s hunger for
food, the three chums made a sudden, unexpected
break for it. They whirled about on
their skis, glided to the edge of the ledge and
took-off down the slope, a hazardous venture.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Hey! Stop! Come back here!” the ringleader
yelled after them.</p>

<p class='c007' >Bang! Bang! ... Bang! Bang! ... Bang!</p>

<p class='c007' >Bullets sung past their ears, spotted tiny holes
in the crusted snow, clipped branches off trees.
Phil, losing his balance, toppled over and broke
through the snow. Max, wavering in a wild
attempt to avoid underbrush, crashed into a tree.
Bill alone avoided mishap and continued on
down the steep hillside.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Go on Bill! Go on!” Max shrieked.</p>

<p class='c007' >The men, raging mad, scrambled over the
ledge and down the hillside in snow up to their
armpits, endeavoring to overtake the two chums
who had met with disaster.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Don’t let ’em get our skis!” Phil cried to
Max. “They can get away if you do! Shove
’em down the hill!”</p>

<p class='c007' >With almost one motion, two pairs of skis
were sent sliding, riderless, down the hillside.
One of them caught against a log but the
other three shot on and on, too far down to
retrieve.</p>

<p class='c007' >The short, stubby man was forced to call for
help, with snow too deep for him. Extricated
by the tall ringleader, he floundered back to the
ledge while his two companions plunged on to
capture Phil and Max.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You boys will pay for this!” gasped the
bandit chief as he grabbed them savagely by
the collars. “What’s the idea of running away,
huh? Go to tell on us, eh?”</p>

<p class='c007' >Back on the ledge, the short, stubby man
rushed into the shack and came out with a high-powered
long range rifle. He knelt on one knee
and sighted it after the diminishing figure of
Bill Stewart who was descending the hill at a
breakneck pace and just about to rush up an
incline where his body would be a good target
against the white snow.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I get him!” cried the stocky bandit.</p>

<p class='c007' >Max, heart palpitating, made a megaphone
of his hands.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Look out, Bill!” he shouted. “Stay off that
hill! Stay off!”</p>

<p class='c007' >His voice reverberated out over the hillside
before his words were cut short by his being
cuffed head first into the snow. Bill, hearing,
swerved his skis to the side, turned them up on
edge and took a tumbling, skidding spill. As
he did so a rifle spat fire ... rat-tat-tat-tat ...
but he dropped down out of sight behind a
snow-covered clump of bushes. The bandit’s
rifle shook snow from these bushes but Phil
and Max, now mutely watching, saw Bill’s
body appear as he crawled along on hands and
knees, around rather than over the hill, pushing
his skis ahead of him and offering the smallest
kind of a target.</p>

<p class='c007' >“He got away!” Phil murmured. “As soon
as he gets on the other side the hill he’ll put
his skis back on and keep right on toward town.
He ought to be there in twenty minutes. What
do you really think they’ll do to us?”</p>

<p class='c007' >Max shook his head and glanced solemnly
at the three desperadoes.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I don’t know,” he said, in an undertone,
“if this isn’t a swell outcome to a skiing
party...!”</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007' >Reaching the outskirts of Centerville, Bill
Stewart pushed forward toward the County Jail
where police and sheriff offices were located.
Arrived at the Jail, breathless and near exhaustion,
he gasped out his story to an astounded
sheriff.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007' >“Wire service has just been resumed,” the
sheriff informed. “Our first report was word
from Boulder, fifty miles above, that just before
the storm Friday, three men robbed the State
Bank there....”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Did anyone get the license number of the
car?” asked Bill.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Yes,” said the sheriff, “it’s....”</p>

<p class='c007' >“M-617-503,” supplied Bill, from memory.</p>

<p class='c007' >“That’s it!” cried the sheriff. “Say!...
But the roads aren’t open yet. How are we
going to get out to them?”</p>

<p class='c007' >Bill thought a moment. “On skis!” he said.
“There’s a lot of them in Slawson’s Hardware
and Sporting Goods Store. Why don’t
you...?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Now there’s an idea!” broke in Sheriff
Marston. “You go inside and get a cup of hot
coffee while I round up a posse ... because
we’ll need you to lead the way!”</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007' >In fifteen minutes, thirty grim-faced men,
all heavily armed with rifles and revolvers,
trooped from the hardware store, each bearing
a pair of brand new skis. An excited crowd of
townspeople saw them off as they fell in behind
Bill for the five mile winding trek up through
the western hills to the top of Mountain Ridge.</p>

<p class='c007' >“If the men are still in the shack,” Bill asked
of Sheriff Marston, as he skied alongside, “how
are you going to get at ’em without injuring
Phil and Max?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“It’s going to be ticklish business,” the sheriff
admitted. “From all reports, these bandits
will stop at nothing. But I’ve got a little object
here that may help considerable.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“What’s that?” asked Bill, curiously.</p>

<p class='c007' >“That,” said Sheriff Marston, “is a tear gas
bomb!”</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007' >“Here we are,” a tired Bill Stewart finally
announced as he paused beside the half-buried
bandit car. “See our ski tracks leading up to
the ridge? The shack’s just below there. Some
of you can go around the ridge one way and
down to the ledge, some the other. If they’re
still in the shack, and it looks like they are,
their only chance of escape is straight down the
hill and that’s no chance at all unless they have
skis.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Fine!” said the Sheriff. “You men station
yourselves as this lad says. He and I will go up
above on the ridge and I’ll call down to those
eggs to surrender. Don’t start firing unless
I signal. We don’t want to risk the lives of
the two boys with ’em ... if we can help it.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Poor Max and Phil,” thought Bill.
“They’re in a tough spot. My part of this
business is soft.”</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007' >“Hello, down there!” the Sheriff shouted
when his men were in place.</p>

<p class='c007' >There was a moment of tingling silence.
Fingers twitched nervously against triggers.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Hel-lo!” the Sheriff repeated, as he and Bill
peered cautiously over the ridge, down upon the
snow-covered shack. There was now no sign
of smoke from the chimney.</p>

<p class='c007' >Z-z-z-ing.</p>

<p class='c007' >The two instinctively ducked back as a bullet
screamed skyward.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Well, we got an answer!” said the Sheriff
as Bill looked his concern. Then, to the barricaded
bandits: “You men are surrounded.
Better walk out with your hands over your
heads and give up peaceable.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Another long, palpitating moment followed.
Then the door to the shack was heard to open
and Bill bit his lips with anxiety as Phil and
Max appeared, hands over their heads, standing
on the edge of the ledge overlooking the valley.
They glanced up, appealingly at the sheriff and
Bill.</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’re being covered,” Phil informed. “Unless
you beat it and leave three pair of skis for
them to use, they’re going to shoot us.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“They mean business,” Max confirmed.
“They’ve got lots of ammunition. We’ll be
killed if you don’t....”</p>

<p class='c007' >Suddenly seized with an idea, Bill raised up
and motioned to his two chums, imitating a dive
off the ledge. Such a dive, Bill reasoned, would
take the bandits by complete surprise. The
ledge was steep enough so that the chums would
immediately disappear from the range of fire
... and with the guns now trained on the
shack, the bandits would not dare rush out to
execute their threat of murder. Phil and Max
nodded to indicate that they understood, both
edging backward. Bill grasped the sheriff’s
arm and conveyed by gestures what was about to
be attempted.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Three pair of skis,” the sheriff repeated.
“Where do they want them...?”</p>

<p class='c007' >Pushing themselves simultaneously off the
ledge in what closely resembled backward swan
dives, Phil and Max landed squirming in the
snow below. There were oaths and angry exclamations
from the shack and a fusillade of
shots, all too late and too misdirected to do any
damage.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Keep the shack covered!” roared the sheriff.
“Don’t let any of ’em out to take pot shots at
the boys!”</p>

<p class='c007' >This was the danger now as Phil and Max
floundered all but helplessly in snow up to their
necks.</p>

<p class='c007' >“How good a tosser are you?” Sheriff Marston
asked of Bill.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Pretty fair,” Bill rejoined, wonderingly.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Here,” said the sheriff, handing him the
tear gas bomb. “See if you can toss this thing
down that chimney. If you can that’ll take
all the fight out of those babies!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Bill took careful aim. He had the ludicrous
thought that he was back on a basketball floor,
with the aperture in the chimney a basketball
hoop. He let go the bomb; it skimmed over
the top, struck the other side, rebounded and
disappeared within the black interior.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Good boy!” commended Sheriff Marston.
“Now watch what happens!”</p>

<p class='c007' >A vapor suddenly curled up from the chimney.
There came sounds of coughing and spitting
and more cursing.</p>

<p class='c007' >“They can’t stick it out in that small shack,”
said the sheriff, confidently. “If they do,
they’ll suffocate! That tear gas bomb had
enough strength to clear a hall.”</p>

<p class='c007' >In less than five minutes the shack door was
wrenched open and the ringleader of the bandits
staggered out, tears streaming down his face,
one hand to his throat, the other extended toward
the grayish heavens. He was followed
by two gasping, stumbling comrades who
breathed in the clear, cold air sobbingly. The
posse closed in with guns drawn. In another
minute the three bandits were submitting to
handcuffs as Bill, hurrying below, helped Phil
and Max back up on the ledge.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Quite a skiing party you brought back with
you,” grinned Phil.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Talk about the thrills of winter time!” Max
added.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Thrills!” whistled Bill. “Say—who knows—maybe
we’ve started something! You’ve
heard of the motorcycle squad, the armored car,
the mounted police and the sky patrol ... but
here’s a new one—the <em>ski police</em>!”</p>

<p class='c007' >The two chums laughed.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Ski police!” they repeated, amused. “Fine—but
who’ll organize ’em?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I will!” Bill volunteered, in a jocular mood
now that the excitement was over, “and all the
assistance I want from you fellows is to arrange
for another snow like this one so we’ll have
something to work on!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='story7' class='c009'>THE PENALTY BOX</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006' >“There’s no use talking, if you want to
win you’ve got to know all the tricks of the
game.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Hoyt Dale, Parker High’s sturdy left defense
man, had been after his team mates all season.
They were more in the mood to listen to him
now, since they had just gone down to a stinging
5 to 2 defeat at the hands of Brinkman Prep.</p>

<p class='c007' >“This makes three straight losses,” snapped
Hoyt, “and we’re going to drop the big game
with Hallstead as sure as shooting, unless...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Unless what?” demanded Rudie Antrim,
who played the other defense position.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Unless you guys learn how to give as well
as take!” Hoyt finished, defiantly. “Every
team that plays us roughs us into the boards
and stick handles us all over the ice. They get
away with murder because Coach has never
taught you fellows how to take care of yourselves.
Why, where I used to play...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“You were brought up on dirty hockey!”
accused Rudie, his face flushing. “We don’t
play that kind of hockey here. We’d rather
lose than...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Oh, yes?” cut in Hoyt, bitingly. “That’s
the trouble with this school. You’ve always
had the idea that hockey’s a parlor game when
it’s really one of the most rugged sports there
is. It can be rough without being dirty ...
but you birds can’t rough it because you don’t
know how!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Team members exchanged consulting
glances. There was an element of truth in
Hoyt Dale’s accusations. Their coach, Professor
Dean Hogart, had admitted that he had
never played the game. His knowledge and
appreciation of the sport had been developed
through observation during years that he had
spent in Canada. Such a background no doubt
left much to be desired but Parker High had
been unable to afford a special hockey coach
since hockey was a new sport for the school and
still lacked sufficient public support.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Something’s wrong with us, that’s certain,”
conceded Walt Lowery, captain and centre.
“Either we lack fighting spirit or...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“You <em>can’t</em> fight,” insisted Hoyt, “unless
you’ve got the tools to fight with. That’s what
I’ve been hitting at all season.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Something in that, too,” admitted Bud
Gray, goalie, glancing about cautiously and
lowering his voice. “Coach Hogart means all
right, gang, but there’s certain inside stuff he
doesn’t know. I think myself we’ve got a much
better team than we’ve shown so far.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Sure we have!” declared Hoyt. “That’s
what burns me up. We ought to be giving each
team we meet the battle of its life. If you fellows
would like me to put you wise to the tricks
I know...?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Why don’t you?” urged Ed Compton, right
wing. “You’ve played more hockey than any
of us.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Well, I-I’d be glad to if Coach wouldn’t
object.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Coach wouldn’t have to know,” suggested
Lee Burrell, left wing. “He’d be for anything
that would improve the team, anyway.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Not if it’s dirty playing,” countered Rudie,
“and that’s what Hoyt’s system sounds like.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“You’ve got dirty playing on the brain,”
charged Hoyt. “You’re sore because I told you
that you weren’t body-checking hard enough.
If you want the truth, Rudie—you’re one of
the weakest spots on the team!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Hoyt Dale, not long a resident in Parker,
believed in speaking his mind. One would have
thought, to hear him, that he was captain of
the team. But Hoyt’s nature was such he could
not keep still for long. Team mates had to
give him credit for an aggressive, unrelenting
style of play. He was always diving into the
midst of mêlées, slashing his stick about madly
and bumping opponents right and left. Occasionally
he made trips to the penalty box as
the referee fouled him for tripping, hitting or
illegally checking a rival but Hoyt was soon
back on the ice as scrappy as ever. His willingness
to mix it with the opposition had established
him as the most colorful player on
Parker’s sextet.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I don’t see how it will hurt any for Hoyt
to help us out,” supported Captain Walt
Lowery, with a clash between Parker’s two
defense men imminent. “And you could afford
to listen to him, too, since three goals were
scored down your side the ice today!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“You know why?” flashed Rudie. “It’s
because Hoyt was grandstanding. He wasn’t
back in position where he should have been and
I was left to guard both sides the ice.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Aw, dry up, Rudie!” snapped Walt. “If
you can’t take a little criticism you don’t belong
on the team. Hoyt’s going to teach us a few
new wrinkles which may come in mighty handy
against Hallstead. And you’d better pay close
attention yourself.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ll pay attention all right,” rejoined Rudie,
and glowered his defiance at the fellow who
had volunteered to impart his superior knowledge
to the squad.</p>

<p class='c007' >It was decidedly unpopular, Rudie knew, to
oppose a player who had turned in a spectacular
brand of hockey all season but he had not liked
Hoyt and his methods from the start. In
Rudie’s estimation, Hoyt was a type who had to
have the limelight at all times. If he didn’t
get it he would either sulk or assume an indifferent
attitude, placing the burden of responsibility
upon someone else. Hoyt liked winners
and winning—so much so, Rudie felt, that he
would be inclined, in a pinch, to sacrifice the
elements of sportsmanship for it. However,
if the fellows were disposed to give him their
ear, it was evident that Rudie would place himself
in disfavor by offering further opposition.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ve already gotten myself in dutch with
the gang,” Rudie observed. “Besides, Hoyt’s
got it in for me and he’ll try to make me look
bad if he can. Only thing for me to do, from
now on, is keep my mouth shut and watch my
step.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Hoyt Dale’s secret hockey lesson proved
something of a sensation. It was Coach Hogart’s
practice, at the finish of the daily session
on the ice, to hurry off to attend to his professorial
duties, leaving the players to take their
showers and change back to street togs. This
particular afternoon, the squad loitered on the
rink until the coach had departed when Hoyt
took charge.</p>

<p class='c007' >“First thing you guys want to learn,” he
snapped, importantly, “is how to guard against
being spilled. You can’t play good hockey flat
on your back and that’s where most of you are
a good many times each game. If you were
onto your business you could spill the other fellow
instead of letting him spill you!”</p>

<p class='c007' >And Hoyt picked Ralph Randall, substitute
wingman, to illustrate how a man could be
body-checked and set down heavily upon the
ice.</p>

<p class='c007' >“If he tries this on you, give him the stick,”
Hoyt advised, and demonstrated by sending
Randall flying through space. “You can bet
your life that he won’t try it a second time,”
Hoyt concluded, grinning.</p>

<p class='c007' >“But that’s illegal!” Rudie protested, finding
it impossible to keep still.</p>

<p class='c007' >“The referee won’t call it once in a dozen
times,” Hoyt answered. “It’s an old trick that’s
being used right along. You’ve got to use it
to protect yourself or you’re all out of luck.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“It sure puts a man out of play,” observed
Ed Compton. “I know now what’s happened
to me when I’ve done high dives. That stick
between your skates...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Here’s another one they’re apt to pull on
you,” said Hoyt, advancing toward Randall.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Hey, no you don’t!” said the sub. “Pick
on somebody else!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I won’t hurt you,” Hoyt reassured. “Not
much, anyway. See, we’re in close quarters,
both of us after a free puck. We’re trying
to jockey each other out of the way. My opponent
comes in and we lock arms. He tries to
give me the elbow in the pit of the stomach
but I beat him to it. Result—it gets his wind
and he slides out of the picture.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Randall, with a gasp, had relinquished his
effort and dropped his stick to the ice.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You couldn’t even see that, could you?”
Hoyt asked, of the interested team members.
“Then how is a referee going to see it?...
And then there’s this one—where you knock a
man’s feet out from under him with a sidewipe
of your skate.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Hoyt picked Hank Tolan, another sub to
demonstrate upon. Hank did a flip-flop and
struck solidly on his side, skidding along the ice.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You get the idea?” pointed Hoyt. “These
are just a few of the things that you’re running
into each game. You should be prepared to
give your opponents the same medicine ...
and to guard against these fast ones. There’s
an art, too, in riding a person into the boards.
Come here, Hank...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“No, thanks!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Hoyt’s knowledge of the various methods
used to upset rival players and effectively cut
them out of the play was close to awe-inspiring.
It was something on the order of a police
lieutenant demonstrating to a bunch of rookies how
to disarm a crook. Hoyt made it look very
simple and very, very impressive.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Say, I thought most of the falls I took were
just the result of bumps that couldn’t be
avoided!” whistled Lee Burrell, “but I can see
now where I’ve been dumped with neatness and
dispatch. Do that over again, will you, Hoyt.
I want to get the hang of it!”</p>

<p class='c007' >The entire squad, a scowling Rudie Antrim
included, set to work to master the various undercover
maneuvers.</p>

<p class='c007' >“This is great!” approved Captain Walt
Lowery, at the end of an hour. “Now I really
feel fortified for the first time. Wish we’d
listened to you earlier in the season, Hoyt. We
might have had a better record.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Well, this ought to give us a chance, at least,
to beat Hallstead,” said Hoyt. “And if we
can take that veteran outfit who think they
know all there is to be known about this game,
it’ll be a big enough feather in our caps.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“You said it!” seconded goalie Bud Gray,
with enthusiasm. “What do you think of
Hoyt’s stuff now, Rudie? Pretty slick, eh?”</p>

<p class='c007' >Rudie’s face flushed. He hated to give this
Hoyt Dale person any credit but he had to admit
that there was a science to the things he had
taught. It had even given him a thrill to send
fellow team mates flying through the air, knowing
that he had done it intentionally, by using
a certain definite system ... a stick between
the legs, a knee properly placed, an elbow in the
right spot, a shoulder brought into play and
other sly little tricks designed to disconcert or
spill the other fellow.</p>

<p class='c007' >“It’s all against the rules,” Rudie replied,
rather lamely, “but I’ll admit it’s worth knowing.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Worth knowing and using at certain times,”
emphasized Hoyt. “If you have to choose between
letting a man get past you and stopping
him from getting through for a possible score,
these little devices are worth everything! What
diff does it make if you <em>do</em> get sent to the penalty
box for two minutes every once in a while?...
That’s part of the game.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I suppose it is,” Rudie considered, “but,
in this case, you’re fouling on purpose ... and
the question is...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“A foul is a foul!” barked Hoyt. “Why
try to distinguish between ’em? A guy as
picayunish as you would find fault with the way
they played ‘drop-the-handkerchief’...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Fellow team members laughed and Rudie
held his tongue. He had broken his resolution
to keep silent as it was. What these special
instructions might lead to was problematical but
one thing was certain—Coach Hogart was due
for a surprise the next time he saw his team in
action!</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007' >Rivals in every other sport, it was natural
that Hallstead should place Parker High on
its schedule when the latter school went in for
hockey. If the truth be known, Hallstead’s
domain in other sports had inspired Parker to
take up the game. Little hope was entertained,
however, that Parker would succeed in downing
Hallstead the first year. Parker had a hard
enough time downing Hallstead in anything.
But, since Hallstead seemed prouder of its ice
hockey six than any other team, Parker High
adherents impatiently awaited the day when
their school might put a serious challenger in
the field.</p>

<p class='c007' >“If there’s any school we enjoy beating, it’s
Hallstead,” declared a Parker fan. “And are
they tough losers? Say, they fight you to the
last ditch in anything! But that’s what I call
real spirit. Our school ought to have more of
it!”</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007' >Underdogs, and very conscious of it, Parker’s
hockey squad dressed for the Hallstead
game. There was little talking in the locker
room, each player feeling the tension too much
to indulge in the usual banter.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Remember, fellows,” whispered Hoyt, just
before the team was to leave the locker room
for the ice, “you’re just as good as Hallstead.
They can’t do anything to you that you can’t
do to them.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Fellow players nodded, grimly. They had
their hearts set on nothing short of victory. A
great showing against Hallstead would do much
to atone for a disappointing season and raise
Parker’s hockey stock to a high level for the
year to follow. Perhaps school authorities
would even be sufficiently impressed to hire a
hockey coach who was an expert at the game.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I know you’re going to give your best,”
Coach Hogart told them. “You boys may not
feel that you have accomplished much this
season but I, personally, think you have done
wonders this first year. Hallstead is primed
and ready with a veteran six and years of experience
behind it. I understand, too, that
Hallstead is noted for a ripping, rushing sort of
game. This ought to be a style well suited to
you fellows because you play clean-cut hockey.
If Hallstead isn’t careful, some of her players
are apt to be spending most of their time in the
penalty box. That being the case, you boys can
be counted on to make the most of your opportunities
during the time that Hallstead may
be forced to play short-handed.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Rudie Antrim, listening to Coach Hogart’s
final words before the game, glanced about uneasily
at team mates. The good old professor
just didn’t have the power to enthuse or excite
team members. His pep talks were punchless,
far too much like classroom lectures. And his
advice now seemed a bit out of place. No suggestion
as to how Parker might cope with Hallstead’s
rough and tumble attack except by playing
clean hockey and taking advantage of possible
Hallstead penalties. In between times,
however, Parker was apparently destined to
absorb considerable punishment.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Coach probably figures, along with everyone
else, that we don’t stand a chance,” thought
Rudie. “Well, I’ll have to hand it to Hoyt
for one thing—he’s actually got the boys pepped
up with the idea that they can win this game.
Hallstead may have it all over us but we’re not
afraid of ’em!”</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007' >It was a crisply cold afternoon with a chilling
breeze which swept the rink and caused a fair-sized
crowd to stamp noisily in the stands.</p>

<p class='c007' >“This’ll have to be a hot game to keep us
warm!” punned someone.</p>

<p class='c007' >“It’ll be hot all right,” promised a Hallstead
rooter. “We’re going to burn up the ice with
Parker!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Chester Maltby, giant Hallstead centre, and
noted as one of the state’s star players, looked
formidable as he moved up and down the ice
in preliminary practice. Hallstead’s season’s
record was marred only by two tie games which
was scarcely any mar at all. Her players sized
the Parker squad up mirthfully.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Easy picking,” the great Maltby was heard
to remark.</p>

<p class='c007' >“When we get through with ’em they’ll be
sorry they ever took up hockey,” a fellow player
rejoined, and laughed.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007' >At the opening face-off, Hallstead took the
puck into Parker territory immediately. Her
forward wall advanced beautifully, brushed past
Parker’s wingmen and drove into the defensive
zone with Hoyt Dale and Rudie Antrim crouching
low to stop the onslaught. Hoyt charged
in fast and gave one of Hallstead’s wingmen a
stiff body-check. He went down in a headlong
slide across the ice and the fans cheered. Play
veered away from Hoyt and swept to Rudie’s
side of the ice.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Stop ’em!” Hoyt shrieked, banging his stick
on the rink.</p>

<p class='c007' >Rudie blocked, was struck, whirled around,
saw the puck beneath his feet, slashed at it, felt
a stick jab between his legs, lost his balance and
was toppled backwards. As he went down the
form of Chester Maltby leaped over him and
swung at the puck, now sliding free in the zone
directly in front of Parker’s cage.</p>

<p class='c007' >“A goal!” cried the crowd, as Hallstead’s
great centre smacked the puck past goalie Bud
Gray into a corner of the net.</p>

<p class='c007' >Hallstead had counted in the first minute of
play!</p>

<p class='c007' >“Hey!” shouted an outraged Hoyt, skating
up and shaking his fist at Rudie. “What did I
tell you the other day? You let them rough you
right out of play. A swell defense man you are!
Snap into it! You’re playing too safe! Cut
loose!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Hallstead team members were grinning.
They could make a shambles of the contest if
they wanted. But what was the use? Parker
was no opposition in this sport at all. Might
as well tease their rivals along. Putting on a
dazzling exhibition of pass work, Hallstead had
her rooters howling with amusement as she
forced Parker to chase her all over the rink,
trying to gain possession of the puck. After five
minutes of this superb team play, Hallstead
slipped through with intentions of scoring another
goal. And again the pass went to Chester
Maltby who was in position for a shot. This
time, however, Chester was blocked—not only
blocked but bowled over by a frenzied dive on
the part of Hoyt Dale.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Off the ice!” ruled the referee and the Hallstead
crowd boohed.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Hold ’em!” Hoyt cried as he got to his feet
and skated to the penalty box.</p>

<p class='c007' >It was a deliberate foul which had obviously
saved almost a sure goal as Chester had been on
top of the net. The puck was faced-off not
far from the cage and a furious mix-up resulted.
It was now five men against Hallstead’s six and
Parker’s entire attention was devoted to the defense
of its goal. Rudie, in the thick of the
fight, felt an elbow thud against his stomach and
wondered whether it was accidental. That was
the trouble ... after Hoyt’s reference to
these things, a fellow was super conscious of
everything that was happening to him ...
trying to figure out when he was being done
dirt or whether it was unintentional. Hallstead
figures loomed on both sides of him and the
puck was down there between a tangle of feet
and smashing sticks. Why not try one or two
of Hoyt’s pet tricks? He was being roughed
plenty. Now, if he could get his stick down
... and shove his foot, just so...!</p>

<p class='c007' >“Yea!”</p>

<p class='c007' >The crowd was yelling at Rudie’s phenomenal
recovery of the puck, emerging from a
wildly struggling group near his goal, upsetting
two Hallstead men as he did so. Rudie skated
around behind his own goal, heart in his mouth,
afraid that the referee would call a foul on him.
But the official had evidently thought developments
the natural outcome of the hot skirmish.
Besides he, Rudie, had the reputation of an extremely
clean player.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I got away with it!” he told himself, as he
skimmed down along the sideboards.</p>

<p class='c007' >The great Maltby cut across the ice with the
idea of heading him off. Rudie saw him coming
out of the corner of his eye.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ll try another Hoyt stunt,” he thought.
“Maltby’s going to try to jam me into the boards.
If I can only stop dead and let him shoot past,
then shoulder him...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Rudie set his skates in the ice; Maltby almost
on top of him, hurtled past, smacked up against
the sideboards, rebounded and was hit jokingly
by the man he had pursued. Maltby went down
in a thudding heap and Rudie recaptured the
puck, continuing his dash down the ice with
Parker rooters going crazy.</p>

<p class='c007' >“This is a cinch!” Rudie told himself, exultantly.
“Hoyt was a hundred percent right
... this knowing how to take care of yourself
... out-roughing the other fellow ... is
what counts in this game!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Hallstead’s defense men were rushing back
into position, having been in Parker’s territory,
trying to help their team score a second goal.
Rudie, seeing them almost upon him, fired a
shot at the goal but the puck was caught by the
broad blade of the goalie’s stick and shoved to
the side. Here Ed Compton and Lee Burrell,
Parker wings, lunged in and did battle with the
defense men for possession of the little black
disc. As they did so, Hoyt’s two minute penalty
was up and he came flashing out of the box to
aid team-mates who had been carrying the
attack to an astounded Hallstead. Ed got
the puck away from a Hallstead man behind
the Hallstead cage, and made a perfect pass-out
to Rudie who had roamed in the front area.
Rudie blazed away at once and sent the puck
whizzing past Hallstead’s goal tender, waist
high, for the goal that tied the score, 1 to 1.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Good boy!” shouted Hoyt, skating up to
slap Rudie on the back. “Now you’re getting
the idea! That was great stuff the way you
fought your way down the ice!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Rudie nodded as he skated back into position
with the crowd cheering him. If a fellow didn’t
care what he did, just played with abandon, it
was surprising what he could accomplish. “Cut
loose!” as Hoyt had said. Rudie had done this
for the first time. Result—one of the few
goals he had ever made in actual play.</p>

<p class='c007' >“A referee overlooks an awful lot,” Rudie
decided, “and maybe I was too strict on what
I thought constituted a foul anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c007' >With things breaking one’s way, it was easy
to salve one’s conscience. And now his team
members were plunging in as the next face-off
occurred at centre, using what Hoyt had taught
them as the occasion demanded. A spectacular
game materialized as this sort of play kept up
with members of both teams crashing into the
sideboards or taking dizzy spills. There were
processions to the penalty box, about evenly
divided up as first one individual, then another,
was ruled out for two minute periods. And still
Rudie led a charmed life; hurling himself into
the fray at every opportunity but escaping without
penalty. Several times, no less a personage
that the great Maltby was sent to the sidelines
for fouling Rudie who had fouled him likewise.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You’ve got it wrong, umps!” Maltby had
protested on the last trip. “He should have
come along with me! That guy...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >The first period ended in a tie score and the
Parker team, having suddenly found itself,
skated from the rink to the roars of the crowd.
This might prove to be a real contest after all!</p>

<p class='c007' >“Boys, you’re simply splendid!” Coach
Hogart greeted them. “A little rougher than
I’ve ever seen you—but perfectly splendid!”</p>

<p class='c007' >The old professor was greatly excited. He
did not observe Hoyt’s wise wink behind his
back, nor the amused grins on several faces.
But, by the end of the furiously contested second
period, when Hallstead and Parker players almost
came to blows over alleged bits of unnecessary
roughness, Coach Hogart sensed definitely
that a change had come over his boys ...
a change which disturbed him not a little....</p>

<p class='c007' >“Watch yourselves,” he warned. “You’ve
held Hallstead to a tie score thus far but you’ve
made more trips to the penalty box than in any
three other games this year. It’s going to be
your downfall if you keep it up ... mark my
words!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Mark his words!” laughed Hoyt, as the
team took the ice for the third and last period.
“Professor Hogart means well but he’s no coach!
and he never will be. I guess you guys realize
now how this game should be played.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Fellow players nodded.</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’ve got the fighting spirit today,” said
Rudie. “That’s what’s doing more for us than
anything else!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’ve got more than that,” rejoined Hoyt.
“We’ve got what Hallstead doesn’t like—an answer
for everything they pull on us! We’ve
spilled old Maltby so much that it’s slowed his
whole game up. The same stuff, gang—and
we’ll worry the life out of this outfit!”</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007' >Hallstead, surprised and miffed at the unusually
stiff brand of opposition Parker was
putting up, took the ice at the start of the third
period resolved to go out in front and stay there.
But Parker met the new attack with increased
resistance and the crowd sat breathless as formation
after formation was broken up by one side
or the other, the puck changing hands with bewildering
rapidity. Hallstead, Rudie now decided,
was playing rough but fair hockey.
Parker, however, was employing the practices
taught by Hoyt when play came to close
quarters. As the pressure of the contest grew hotter
and hotter, these little devices became more
obvious.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Careful, fellows!” Rudie couldn’t help
warning, during a time-out. “You’re going too
far in a minute. I’ve never felt right about this
... we’ve got a chance for the game if...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“You’re okay!” broke in Hoyt. “Going great
guns! Keep it up!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Hoyt looked to Captain Walt Lowery for
support and got it, in an approving nod. Victory
over Hallstead was the bait—an unbelievable
victory! There were just six more minutes
of play. The game might go into overtime...!</p>

<p class='c007' >Mustering his forces, Chester Maltby, great
Hallstead centre, sallied determinedly into
Parker territory, determined to crack her defense
wide open. With wingmen on either side
of him and a defense man joining in the attack,
forming a four-man forward wall, the advance
began.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Look out, gang!” shouted Hoyt, and braced
himself for the impact.</p>

<p class='c007' >Maltby feinted a pass as he raced down upon
Hoyt with the puck riding along at the end of
his stick, then veered at the last moment and
attempted to get around Parker’s left defense.
Hoyt, thrown off guard, could not apply his
usual body-check and had only time to ram his
stick out. The stick caught Maltby between the
legs and catapulted him.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Booh!” roared Hallstead fans. “Take him
out!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“A major penalty for you!” shrilled the
referee, skating over and pushing Hoyt to the
sidelines. “Five minutes for this man!” he
called to the timers.</p>

<p class='c007' >“What for?” demanded Hoyt, registering innocence.
“I only tried to get the puck. I...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ve been watching you the whole game,”
flashed the referee. “You’ve pulled that stunt
once too often!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Wow—maybe that penalty doesn’t hurt!”
moaned a Parker rooter, as Hoyt, still protesting,
slid into the penalty box. “He’s out for
practically the rest of the game which shoots our
defense and breaks up our attack.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Parker team members glanced concernedly
at one another as a fighting Hallstead lined up
close to Parker’s goal for a face-off.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You see—it doesn’t pay!” cried Rudie.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Shut up!” blazed Captain Lowery, who was
on edge. “Get in there! Don’t let ’em score!”</p>

<p class='c007' >The referee dropped the puck to ice. It was
lost almost at once in the mad turmoil which
followed. Goalie Bud Gray did heroic work
in warding off a rain of vicious shots. But still
Hallstead kept battering with Parker fighting
the harder to atone for the loss of their defense
men. A cry went up as two Hallstead players
were bumped to the ice in front of the net.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Off the ice—you and you!” barked the
referee, and slapped two Parker players on the
back—Left Wing Lee Burrell and Captain
Walt Lowery!</p>

<p class='c007' >“It’s three against six now!” gasped a spectator.
“What’s the matter with Parker? I’ve
never seen so much fouling!”</p>

<p class='c007' >A scowling Hoyt Dale moved over to make
room for his two team-mates in the penalty box.</p>

<p class='c007' >“This is not so good,” were Captain Lowery’s
first words.</p>

<p class='c007' >“The ref’s got it in for us because I kicked
when he put me out,” Hoyt rejoined.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You’re wrong!” returned Walt, remorsefully.
“He’s just gotten wise to us, that’s all!
We put up a game like this and then have to lose
it on...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“... fouls!” finished Lee, feelingly.
“Swell advice you gave us, Hoyt!... We
ought to have known better!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’re not licked yet,” retorted Parker’s left
defense, hopefully, and made a megaphone of
his hands. “Stay with ’em, Rudie—big boy—careful
in there—don’t let ’em put you in the
penalty box!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Rudie, who had been conferring with his two
remaining team-mates, right wing Ed Compton
and goalie Bud Gray, looked toward the three
deposed players in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c007' >“What did he say?” he asked of Ed.</p>

<p class='c007' >“They’re all shouting now,” said Ed. “Telling
us to play it safe so we won’t make any fouls
... and hold ’em till they get back in the
game!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Can you beat it?” exclaimed Rudie, and
grinned.</p>

<p class='c007' >But the referee was calling another face-off
not far from Parker’s net and Hallstead had all
five men down the ice—five actually against two—in
an effort to jam the puck home while
Parker was so severely handicapped.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Listen, fellows!” pleaded Rudie, of Ed and
Bud. “Hoyt’s had his say now and you see
where it’s gotten us. Here’s our chance to show
what can be done—on the square. Are you with
me?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Sure we’re with you!” cried Bud, crouching
in the mouth of the cage.</p>

<p class='c007' >“All the way!” seconded Ed.</p>

<p class='c007' >And the battle was on! Rudie was knocked
off his feet, stepped on, hit with sticks and
swarmed over as five Hallstead men sought to
get the puck from under him. He finally recovered
his feet and sent the puck whizzing up
the ice out of danger. Hallstead chased it, took
on another formation, and came dashing back on
the attack, five men abreast, with only two
Parker men to face the charge. This time it
was Ed who went down under flashing Hallstead
heels and only Rudie was left to battle
the invaders. He was shoved into the cage in
a furious assault, wedged in alongside goalie
Bud Gray, but—between them—they kicked
the puck free.</p>

<p class='c007' >“What hockey!” Hoyt was screaming.
“That’s holding ’em, you guys!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“They can’t keep this up much longer!”
said Captain Lowery, nervously. “How many
seconds are we out of play yet?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Fifty!” informed Lee, who sat next the
timer, biting finger nails already chewed to the
quick. “Gee, this last minute’s been an hour!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Once more, led by Chester Maltby, Hallstead
rallied to the attack. And once more two valiant
Parker men, fighting with a frenzy equal
to five, met the rush head-on. But both went
down under jolting impacts and goalie Bud
Gray was left to face the onslaught alone. He
was met, however, by a wave of blue-jerseyed
men and was pulled to the side on blocking a
shot so that the puck was whizzed past him on
the rebound.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Goal disallowed!” shrieked the referee,
tearing into the mix-up in front of the net and
tapping Chester Maltby on the shoulder. “Penalty
box for you,” he signified, “and you...!”
referring to the Hallstead right defense. A
great clamor went up as the two Hallstead
players joined an already crowded penalty box.
Out on the ice, Ed and Rudie solemnly shook
hands. They were still in the thick of the fight
and now the competition was almost even again
... three against two. But Lee and Walt were
due back on the ice now, any second, which
would swing the advantage in Parker’s favor.
And less than two minutes of the regular playing
time remained!</p>

<p class='c007' >A new face-off with Rudie opposing the
Hallstead right wing. He managed to get his
stick on the puck and hook it away. As he
skated to the side with Hallstead players in
pursuit, he saw Lee and Walt tumbling out of
the penalty box and rushing back into play.
Changing his defensive tactics at once, Rudie
suddenly raced up the ice toward Hallstead’s
goal, leaving two frantic Hallstead men behind
him. The third, playing back on defense, took
his station in front of the goalie and awaited
Rudie’s attack. Lee and Walt, however, were
joining Rudie from the side, spanking their
sticks on the ice. The puck skimmed across to
them and all three swung into formation, sweeping
in upon the under-guarded Hallstead goal.
Ed to Rudie to Walt was the course the puck
took as the trio neared the cage. Rudie was
violently body-checked by the lone defense man
but Walt was left free to skate in upon the
goalie and sent the puck hurtling into the net.</p>

<p class='c007' >“A goal!” scored the referee.</p>

<p class='c007' >Hallstead sat thunderstruck; Parker supporters
made the air warm with lusty shouts. In
another minute a dope bucket would be violently
upset. Hoyt Dale now leaned forward in the
penalty box, his five minute suspension almost
up. In another three seconds he was back on
the ice, Parker’s full strength returned, with
Hallstead still shy her two regulars.</p>

<p class='c007' >“No monkey business!” warned Captain
Lowery.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Don’t worry!” a chastened Hoyt assured.
“They don’t get me in that penalty box again!”</p>

<p class='c007' >And the next instant the game was over.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Rudie, old timer!” cried the fellow who
had thought he knew more than the coach. “I
take back everything I ever said against you.
That defense you put up was simply immense
... and it was me who put you in that
hole...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“It’s okay now,” said Rudie, as he glanced at
the scoreboard.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Oh, no it’s not,” replied Hoyt, as guilty
looking team members gathered around. “I
owe all you guys an apology. All we’ve needed
is more fight. And speaking of fair play—say,
after my starting you off on the wrong foot,
Rudie and Lee had me scared stiff. I was afraid
they’d join us in the penalty box and leave only
poor Bud out there to defend the goal! Did
I suffer torture?... I threw my ideas overboard
right then. They’re all wet!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ll say they are!” agreed Captain Walt
Lowery, with a supporting chorus. “You can
get by with this stuff just so long and after that—you’re
out of luck!”</p>

<p class='c007' >It was here that an elated Coach Hogart burst
in upon them. “Your play was magnificent!”
he cried. “Everyone of you fairly outdid himself.
You’re all to be congratulated!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Parker High’s victorious team members
grinned, looked a bit sheepishly at one another
and decided to say nothing. What the old
professor, who had loyally volunteered to coach
them, didn’t know, wouldn’t hurt him, because
it was never going to happen again.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='story8' class='c009'>CRISS-CROSSED SKIS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006' >Skiing is loads of fun. If you don’t believe it,
ask Mr. Sylvester B. Turner, who owns the only
hill in town worth skiing on. He’ll tell you
what fun it is—and if you’re not hit over the
head with the nearest thing at hand, you’ll be
lucky. But maybe Mr. Turner’s cooled down
some since last winter. Honest, he was hot
enough that time to have melted snow!</p>

<p class='c007' >How’d it all happen? Well, you see, we fellows
used to slide and ski on Randolph Hill
before Mr. Turner bought it. After that, he
puts up “Don’t Trespass” signs all over the place
but even then we don’t think he means us. The
first time we put our feet on his ground, though,
he raises an awful holler. And the worst of it
is—Mr. Turner’s one and only son, Ronald,
tattles on us.</p>

<p class='c007' >Ronnie, we call him, is a mamma’s boy if
there ever was one. He’s thin and scared looking,
if you get what I mean—the sort who wears
rubbers if there’s a cloud in the sky. You can’t
point your finger at him without his running
home and telling about it. Talk about sensitive!
Mack Sleder asked him “how come his hair
wasn’t combed?” one morning and Ronnie almost
busts out crying. Perhaps he can’t help
it. But you know how fellows are, if a guy acts
that way, they poke a lot of fun at him. Ronnie
steers pretty clear of us, though. He knows
what’s good for him. Besides, Ronnie doesn’t
go in for sports. He hates to get bumped or
dirtied up and then, too, there’s always the
chance of getting hurt.</p>

<p class='c007' >“What’s the sense in it?” he asks us one time.
“I’d much rather sit in a hammock and read a
good book.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Aren’t you afraid the hammock might turn
over with you?” kids Tommy Fox.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’d never thought of that,” says Ronnie,
soberly. “That’s worth considering, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c007' >And he sits on the porch steps after that.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007' >Ronnie’s Dad is as big and blustering as Ronnie
is timid and quiet. And talk about dignified!
Mr. Sylvester B. Turner expects everyone to
bow and scrape before him since he’s the richest
man in town and owns the biggest factory besides
the biggest hill. Everything has to be
big with Mr. Turner. That’s his style. The
biggest house, the biggest car, the biggest noise
... and the biggest boob for a son. That’s
how we feel, anyhow, after Mr. Turner’s high
and mighty manner and Ronnie’s yelling: “Dad,
look what the fellahs are doing!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Are we downhearted? You can just imagine!
Being chased off old Randolph Hill
is like having our sleds and skis taken away from
us on account of there being no other decent
place. We could understand this high hat business
if Mr. Turner was using the hill for anything
else but it slopes off for over a mile behind
his big house, going down on one side to
Mitchell Creek and down the other to a meadow
that’s fenced in with an old rail fence. We’ve
been sliding and skiing straight down the hill,
though, the long way, which carries us across
the old Strawtown Pike and up against a bank
that finally stops us. It’s one grand ride,
whether you take it by sled or by skis ... only,
of course, it’s lots more exciting on skis. We
figured this year that we’d grade the bank, too,
and use it for a jumping off place. Whether
you know it or not, ski jumping is the real
sport. You may land on your head or back
or some other part of your anatomy but that’s
half the sport! And here Mr. Turner is so
stingy that he closes his estate to the whole
neighborhood!</p>

<p class='c007' >“You must remember, James,” my father
says to me, “Mr. Turner has a perfect right to
do this. It’s his property. Old Mr. Randolph
was very nice to let you boys use the hill but you
shouldn’t feel too hard against Mr. Turner because
he refuses. After all, it can’t be so enjoyable
to have a mob of kids tracking all over.
Maybe Mrs. Turner is very high strung. Maybe
their boy is nervous and can’t stand strenuous
exercise or excitement. Maybe that’s why Mr.
Turner bought the place, so he could be off by
himself with his family. You must take this
all into consideration.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I still think he’s just doing it to be mean,”
says I. “He likes to put on airs. As for his son,
if Ronnie’s mother would let him be himself,
we’d make a man out of him in no time!”</p>

<p class='c007' >My Dad throws back his head and let loose
a laugh.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You fellows had better leave well enough
alone,” he warns. “You ought to know by this
time that Ronald has a ‘Don’t Trespass’ sign
hanging on him, too. And since Mr. Turner
has phoned me and complained about your being
on his property, I don’t care to have any further
trouble with our new neighbor. You mustn’t
forget, either, that my company does considerable
business with Mr. Turner’s factory. We
can’t afford to have Mr. Turner down on us.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“You’re right, Dad,” I agrees. “I guess I’m
still peeved, that’s all. Made me feel like I
wanted to get even. The other guys feel that
way, too. Some of ’em were going to take it
out on Ronnie—but I’ll have a talk with ’em
and fix it up. I wouldn’t want to do anything
that would interfere with your business.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I know you wouldn’t,” Dad replies, then
puts a hand on my arm. “I’m sorry about that
hill. If I owned it I’d turn it over to the town
for a public playground.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Picture Mr. Turner doing a thing like
that!” I explodes. “He’s not interested in this
community. He’s just interested in what he can
take out of it.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Dad nods. “The answer probably is,” he
says; thoughtfully, “that Mr. Turner’s never
learned how to play.”</p>

<p class='c007' >And, do you know—Dad’s explanation all of
a sudden soaks in! The more I think it over,
the sorrier I commence to feel for Mr. Turner
for what he’s been missing all his life. And
the tough part is that his son’s starting out the
same way.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Maybe we could return good for evil,” it
occurs to me. “I’ll have to get the gang together
and see what they think about it.”</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007' >Talk about a conference! There’s just six
of us fellows and each of us has more ideas than
we know what to do with ... which means
that there’s usually six leaders and no followers.
Some don’t want to have anything more to do
with the Turners; others claim, if we did try
to be nice, it wouldn’t be appreciated; and
Tommy Fox asks me what I expect to gain for
my trouble.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Probably nothing,” I rejoins, “except the
satisfaction of playing missionary to the heathen
on the hill!”</p>

<p class='c007' >This brings a laugh.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Okay!” seconds Mack Sleder. “It’s going
to be torture for us, but mamma’s boy Ronnie
gets invited to join our gang the next time we
see him.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“And he’ll turn us down flatter than a fallen
cake,” Eddie Hale predicts.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Well, it’s Jim’s idea,” says Mack. “I’m for
trying anything once.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Getting ahold of Ronnie isn’t so easy. Every
time he sees us coming he runs around the block
or cuts across lots. We’re just so much poison
to him and he figures, since his father’s
laid down the law about our using the hill, that
we’ll pretty near scalp him if we get the
chance.</p>

<p class='c007' >But one snowy day we get Ronnie from in
front and behind. His arms are full of groceries
which he wouldn’t have been getting himself
only the delivery truck is stuck in a drift and
his mother has to have the food for dinner.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Let me go, you guys!” he begs. “If you
dare touch me, my Dad’ll...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Listen, you!” says Mack, with his hand on
Ronnie’s shoulder. “Don’t cry before you’re
hurt. We’ve been trying to catch you for some
time.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Y-yes, I—I know,” says Ronnie, trembling
from head to foot. “D-don’t make me d-drop
these eggs, or you’ll b-be sorry.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Oh, he’s got eggs!” says Mack, and winks
at the bunch. For a minute I think he’s going
to change his mind and pull something.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You don’t like us, do you?” Tommy demands.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Why—why—I certainly do.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Then why do you try to beat it every time
you see us?”</p>

<p class='c007' >Ronnie swallows and looks the next thing to
miserable.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I—I’ve got to be getting home with these
groceries,” he says. “My mother’s waiting....”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Answer my question!” demands Tommy,
looking vicious.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I—I’ve forgotten it,” stammers Ronnie.
“It’s storming harder, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Yes—it’ll be great weather for skiing after
this snow packs down,” says Eddie, pointedly.</p>

<p class='c007' >Ronnie blinks and glances around like he’s
going to yell for help.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Cut it,” says I, pushing the fellows back and
taking matters in my own hands. “Ronnie,
old boy, this must be a pretty lonely life you’re
living,” I begins.</p>

<p class='c007' >“These groceries are getting heavy,” Ronnie
answers, shifting his packages around. “And
I’m getting snow down the back of my neck.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“You shouldn’t be alone so much,” I keeps
on. “It’s bad for a guy to play by himself all
the time. It makes him self-centered and mean.
Besides, there’s no fun in it. What you need is
to get out with the gang—to be one of us!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“<em>What?</em>” Ronnie’s mouth comes wide open.</p>

<p class='c007' >“There goes the eggs!” shouts Mack, making
a grab at the sack. He picks it out of a snowbank
and looks inside. “Okay—only a couple
cracked—none of ’em broken.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Yes, Ronnie,” I repeats, as I help hold him
up. “One of us! We’d be proud to count you
as a member of our Rough and Ready Club.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“You—you <em>would</em>?” Ronnie stares at us
suspiciously.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You bet we would!” assures Mack. “We’d
be tickled to initiate you!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Initiate?” gulps Ronnie, and tries to get
away. “No, sir! I don’t want to join your club.
I want to go home!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Listen,” says I, kicking Mack in the shins,
“we’re willing to make an extra special exception
in your case—and let you join without
any initiation.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Well...,” considers Ronnie, “I—I’d
have to ask my Dad first. He doesn’t believe
much in joining things. He says a man should
be able to stand alone.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“He’s wrong,” speaks up Tommy. “Doesn’t
your Dad know that ‘united we stand, divided
we fall’?”</p>

<p class='c007' >Ronnie stares. “I don’t believe he ever
heard of that,” he says. “But I’ll tell him.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Don’t you tell him a thing!” I orders.
“Can’t you decide anything for yourself. Do
you have to run home and ask papa or mamma
every time you want to blow your nose?”</p>

<p class='c007' >Ronnie’s face gets red. “Not exactly,” he
says, faint-like. “These groceries...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’ll help you carry ’em home,” I volunteers,
“as far as the bottom of the hill, anyway.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Sure!” says Mack, and grabs the sack of
eggs. “Oh, oh! There’s another one cracked!
Man—these eggs are tough—you can crack
’em but you can’t break ’em.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Mother will throw a fit,” Ronnie observes,
ruefully. He stares about him, badly worried,
because his groceries are divided up between six
fellows, and he’s probably wondering if he’s
ever going to get ’em back.</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’re not a bad bunch—honest!” I tells
him, as we walk along, keeping our heads down
against the wind and the snow. “Trouble is—you
and us haven’t ever gotten acquainted. We
think you’re a real guy underneath.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Say—you ought to see Ronnie warm up! I
guess he’s been starved for talk like this ...
someone to take an interest in him. He’s still
afraid we’re going to take a backhanded slap
at him, though.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I—I <em>don’t</em> get out much,” he confesses.
“There’s lots of things I’d like to do if...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Fine!” busts in Mack. “You come with us
and you can do ’em!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Could I learn to ski?” Ronnie asks.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Ski?” we cry, and now it’s our turn to gasp
for breath. “Ski?... Would you really like
to learn to ski?”</p>

<p class='c007' >We can’t believe our ears. Can you imagine
this? It just goes to show that you can’t judge
any fellow until you get right on the inside of
him. If Ronnie was asking us to teach him how
to play checkers or blindman’s buff ... but—skiing!
Maybe he’s spoofing us.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Skiing looks like fun,” says Ronnie.
“Mother thinks it’s too dangerous, but you fellows
don’t seem to get hurt.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Naw, of course we don’t,” I replies. “I tell
you what you do, Ronnie! You come out with
us and we’ll show you how to ski and then, after
you know just how to do it, you can surprise your
mother! Just imagine the look on her face
when she sees you skiing up the hill to the
house!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Y-yes, I—I can imagine!” falters Ronnie.
Then his face takes on a hopeful expression. “I
guess she’d feel all right about it when she saw
how perfectly safe it was, wouldn’t she?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Sure!” declares Mack, slapping Ronnie on
the back and almost dropping the egg sack.
“Every mother’s that way! Too bad, though,
that your old man—I mean—your father—kicked
us off the hill.” Mack nudges me and I
try to stop him, but he’s got what he thinks is
a great idea and he goes on. “I guess you
weren’t so crazy to have us on the hill, either.
Just the same—it’s the best place around here to
learn to ski.”</p>

<p class='c007' >We’re just at the foot of the hill as Mack says
this. It’s the street side of the hill and we’re
looking up the steps to the big house on top.
Somehow it reminds us of a fort that’s almost
lost in the snow. We’re half expecting to hear
some words fired out at us from Mr. Turner’s
booming voice but we evidently can’t be seen
from up above. Ronnie hasn’t said anything
yet in answer to Mack’s bold crack about the hill
for skiing and I’m thinking to myself that he’s
spoiled everything.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I had the wrong idea about you fellows,”
Ronnie suddenly blurts out as we return his
groceries. “That’s why I told Dad. He seldom
goes out on the back hill. I don’t see how
the tracks you’d make in the snow would hurt
anything. If you’d like to meet me out there
tomorrow afternoon while Dad’s downtown...?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“<em>Would</em> we?” we all shout.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I haven’t any skis,” says Ronnie.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ll loan you mine!” I offers. “But what
if your Dad should find out? He gave us strict
orders...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Well,” considers Ronnie, starting up the
steps. “I suppose the worst he could do would be
to put you off again.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“He wouldn’t be hard on us if Ronnie was
along,” encourages Tommy.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Okay!” I decides. “We’ll be there, Ronnie!
From now on—you’re one of the gang!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Ronnie’s face actually beams. Then he takes
an anxious look up the stairs.</p>

<p class='c007' >“If I don’t get home with these groceries...!”
he says, “Mother’ll have the
police looking for me.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“You leave it to us,” I calls after him as he
runs up the steps. “We’ll make a skier out of
you!”</p>

<p class='c007' >And the second Ronnie’s disappeared in the
house, we all start to dancing jigs in the snow,
with Mack patting himself on the chest and declaring:
“I guess I put it over, eh ... what?
Got Ronnie to take us back on the old hill! And
say—maybe we were wrong. If we give this
bird half a chance he may not turn out a
mamma’s boy after all!”</p>

<p class='c007' >The next afternoon we don’t feel quite so
gay. It’s stopped snowing and the skiing ought
to be swell but the thoughts of what Mr. Turner
might do and say if he ever got wise that we
were on the hill again without his permission
has made us kind of shy and nervous. We’re not
so sure that even Ronnie’s being there will help
any in case...! In fact, Eddie suggests that
maybe Mr. Turner would blame us for inveigling
Ronnie into skiing and using the
forbidden hill. Inveigle is a terrible sounding word
and, while we’re crazy to ski, we’re not wild to
ski into any more trouble.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Besides,” points out Carl, “if Ronnie
should get a bump like we all do, once in a while,
we’re the guys who’ll have to answer for it.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“It’s quite a responsibility all right,” admits
Mack, “but I say it’s worth the risk. We certainly
can run as fast as Mr. Turner.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Not if he sees us first,” I warns, “so we’d
better keep our eyes peeled. My old pair of
skis ought to be good enough for Ronnie to
learn on, don’t you think?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Sure,” rejoins Tommy. “He’ll probably
break ’em anyway—hit a tree or something.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Aren’t you cheerful?” I razzes. “Well,
that’s not going to happen if I have to go down
the hill ahead of him and bend the trees out of
the way!”</p>

<p class='c007' >There’s a familiar figure sitting on a fallen
log and waiting for us when we climb over the
fence and sneak up the hill behind the Turner
house. Ronnie jumps up when he spies us, as
tickled as a kid, who’s about to try something
he’s never done before.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I—I thought maybe you wouldn’t come.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Ronnie—we are here!” says Mack, officially
and solemnly. “Your lesson is about to
begin!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“But first,” breaks in Tommy, “how many
miles is your father from here?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“He’s downtown,” reassures Ronnie. “He’s
hardly ever back before five o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Then I guess the coast is clear,” says Eddie.</p>

<p class='c007' >“It is—straight down the hill,” I replies,
meaning something different. “But you got
to watch out for the creek and the fence on the
sides. Here’s your skis, Ronnie. You shove
your feet into the harness like this.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Ronnie is all eyes. He lifts up his feet and
lets me fix them onto the long strips of hardwood.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You—you’re not going to send me down this
steep hill first off, are you?” he asks, plenty
nervous.</p>

<p class='c007' >“No, of course not. We’re going to let you
ski around on top of the hill here, where it’s
flat ... and get used to the thing. Stand
up now and see how you feel.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Ronnie straightens up and looks down at the
funny contraptions on his feet. He lifts one
ski up and tries to take a step forward. It turns
sidewise and plops down on top of the other ski.
Ronnie’s legs get crossed and he sits down ker-plunk.
We grin and Ronnie looks worried.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Aren’t these skis a little too long for me?”
he inquires. “Are you sure they’re my size?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Skis don’t come in sizes,” I informs. “You
lifted your foot too high. It’s a sliding motion—like
this.” And I demonstrates.</p>

<p class='c007' >“It’s easy, isn’t it?” says Ronnie, and untangles
himself.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Sure!” encourages Mack, “when you get
onto it—it’s like falling off a log ... or a
cliff ... or anything....”</p>

<p class='c007' >Ronnie stares at Mack a minute and then
glances toward the brink of the hill.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I couldn’t get started down hill without
wanting to, could I?” he questions.</p>

<p class='c007' >“If you did, we’d grab you,” I tells him.
“Now try it again. Move your right foot forward.
Keep your body inclined just a bit.
That’s the way. You look just like a skier now!
Doesn’t he, fellows?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Exactly!” they agree.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Don’t move and spoil it!” directs Mack who
can’t help making sport of things.</p>

<p class='c007' >Ronnie looks kind of bewildered.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Go ahead,” says I. “Don’t mind what that
boob says. He’s a bum skier anyway.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I am, am I?” challenges Mack.</p>

<p class='c007' >And down he goes over the hill, making the
first tracks in the glistening snow. It’s breathless
to watch him as he gains speed, whizzes
across the old Strawtown Pike and up the embankment
where he comes to a stop. He’s a
black dot to us now as he turns to wave his hands
and then start the long journey back.</p>

<p class='c007' >“That’s wonderful!” breathes Ronnie. “Oh,
if I could only do that!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“You’ve got to creep before you can ski,” I
instructs. “Don’t get impatient. A good skier
wasn’t built ... I mean—made—in a day.
We’ll come out again ... that is ... if
your Dad doesn’t stop us.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Dad’s never had any time for sports,” explains
Ronnie. “He’s been too busy. He thinks
young men should ... er ... expend their
energies on more worthwhile things....”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Well, I ... er ... don’t exactly agree
with him,” says I. “But, of course, we can’t
all think the same.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“All work and no play,” recites Tommy,
winking at the rest of us, “makes Dad a dull
boy.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“He means ‘any Dad’,” I hastens to explain.
“Now you just ski along beside me till you get
the hang of this. Then we’ll try a little slope
back here which I’m sure you can safely ...
er ... negotiate.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Safely—<em>what</em>?” Ronnie asks.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Jim means,” defines Tommy, getting back
at me, “a slope you can safely descend without
any <em>untoward incident</em>....”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Oh!” says Ronnie.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007' >We spend a good hour, Ronnie and me, getting
him familiar with having skis on his feet.
Meanwhile the rest of the guys are having a
swell time skiing down the hill and I’m commencing
to think that I’m the martyr to the
cause, being crazy to do some real skiing myself.</p>

<p class='c007' >“How about it?” I ask, finally, “do you feel
like you can go it alone?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“It’s quite simple now,” says Ronnie. “Do
you mean you think I’m ready to ski down the
hill?”</p>

<p class='c007' >The question gives me a chill. Skiing on a
plane surface and skiing down hill is as different
as walking in broad daylight and skating
in the dark with roller skates.</p>

<p class='c007' >“You’d better stick to just what you’re doing
for a couple days,” I advises. “You’re getting
along swell.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I feel quite confident,” replies Ronnie.
“This is mostly a matter of balance ... something
I’ve always been good at. I walked our
clothes line once. Everything would have been
all right if it hadn’t busted.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Yes,” says I, “Most things would be okay
if something didn’t happen. But you use your
own judgment, Ronnie. If you think you’re
ready to go down the hill, it’s up to you. Only
don’t blame me if you suffer any ... er ...
minor accident.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“How could I blame you?” Ronnie wants to
know. “I’m awfully grateful for all you’ve
taught me. This is the most fun I’ve had in
months ... maybe years....”</p>

<p class='c007' >“That’s fine,” I replies. “Here’s hoping you
keep on having fun.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“That’s why I want to go down the hill,”
declares Ronnie. “I imagine that would give
me a real sensation.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“It’s the big thrill in skiing,” Mack puts in,
being eager to see Ronnie make his first attempt.
“Just follow my tracks, Ronnie, if you decide to
go down, and you can’t go wrong!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I—I believe I’ll do it,” says Ronnie, after
taking a deep breath. “It’s a long ways down.
I probably won’t be able to ski back up the hill.
That looks a lot harder.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Aim for that embankment across the Pike,”
points out Mack. “See if you can beat my
mark.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Oh, I couldn’t do that first off,” returns
Ronnie, modestly. “I’d be satisfied if I could
tie it. I imagine my momentum will be about
the same so I should travel about as far.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“There’s no doubt about it—you’ll travel!”
assures Tommy.</p>

<p class='c007' >“If this works out all right,” says Ronnie,
“I’ll have my Dad see me do it and maybe he’ll
change his mind about letting you fellows use
the hill. Of course he mustn’t know that you’ve
taught me. He’s to think that all these tracks
are mine.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Ronnie,” says I, “my hat’s off to you.
You’re a regular sport. And what’s more—I
admire your nerve.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Oh, this doesn’t take nerve,” disparages
Ronnie. “It just takes skill.”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Well, have it your own way,” says Mack,
and we all stand around to watch the take-off.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Feet together,” I directs, feeling shaky inside.
“Lean forward a little more. That’s it!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Goodbye, fellows!” calls Ronnie, as he
moves toward the spot where the hill slopes
down, eyes glued ahead.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Goodbye!” we shout.</p>

<p class='c007' >It sounds to me like we’re saying goodbye for
a long time. There’s a sickening feeling comes
in the pit of my stomach as Ronnie suddenly
disappears over the brow of the hill and shoots
down. Say—have you ever ridden in a roller
coaster? Well—you zip down a steep hill on
skis and tell me which gives you the biggest
heart throb. In a coaster you can at least hold
onto the rod and sit tight. On skis you’ve got
to hold yourself just so or you may find yourself
flying through space and landing hard enough
to jar your wisdom teeth.</p>

<p class='c007' >“So far, so good,” says Mack, when Ronnie’s
half way down.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I don’t care to look,” I rejoins, getting
panicky. “I never should have let him gone!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“He’s doing swell!” cries Tommy. “Oh—oh,
no! He’s not doing so good now! He’s
veering to the right. He’s off the course. He’s
heading for the fence!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Good grief!” I exclaims, and takes a look.
“Sit down, Ronnie!” I yells, making a megaphone
of my hands. “Sit down—quick!”</p>

<p class='c007' >But Ronnie doesn’t hear me. He’s too
wrapped up in his own problem.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Oh, my gosh!” gasps Eddie, “that tree!”</p>

<p class='c007' >How Ronnie missed a big oak, I don’t know.
He just shaves it and goes on, right through a
clump of underbrush and down a steep grade
toward the fence, his body weaving back and
forth as he’s fighting to keep his balance.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Look out!” I screams, and then it happens.</p>

<p class='c007' >Ronnie hits the fence ker-smash and goes
right on over, doing the niftiest frontward
somersault you ever saw, and landing head first
in a snow drift with only his skis sticking out.
We’re all of us so petrified that we stand there a
couple seconds, not knowing what to do or
say. Then we see Ronnie’s feet kick and his
head come out of the snow.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ll bet he’s hurt!” I cries. “I’m going
down to him!”</p>

<p class='c007' >As I’m strapping on my skis, though, the fellows
bust out laughing.</p>

<p class='c007' >“What’s so funny?” I demands.</p>

<p class='c007' >“He’s waving at us!” roars Tommy, “he
thinks that’s great stuff! I don’t think he’s hurt
a bit!”</p>

<p class='c007' >I stand up and stare and we all wave back.
Ronnie starts trying to climb the fence with
his skis still on but he finds this doesn’t work
so good, so he takes ’em off. And when I’m
sure he isn’t hurt, I take to laughing myself.
Honest, I haven’t seen such a funny spill since
I can remember. Talk about innocence abroad!
The way Ronnie has gone down the hill, so sure
he has known all he needed to know about
skiing!</p>

<p class='c007' >“So you’re laughing at my boy, eh?” says a
big voice behind us.</p>

<p class='c007' >Wow! We just about freeze in our tracks!
As we turn around, there’s Mr. Turner, so mad
he can hardly see straight. How long he’s been
standing there, we don’t know, but it’s probably
been plenty long enough. And now we’re going
to catch it!</p>

<p class='c007' >“My wife thought something was up,” says
the man who owns the hill, “so she phoned me
and I came home. This is what you do behind
my back, is it?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“It was your son’s idea,” explains Tommy,
who’s scared green. “He wanted us to teach
him how to ski....”</p>

<p class='c007' >“So this is the way you do it—start him down
this big hill?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I told him he’d better not try it,” says I.</p>

<p class='c007' >“When I want my son to know anything, I’ll
teach him!” booms Mr. Turner. “You boys
aren’t going to make a laughing stock of him!
I used to ski when I was a boy and I....”</p>

<p class='c007' >“<em>You?</em>” Mack exclaims, unbelievingly.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Yes, <em>me</em>!” thunders Mr. Turner. “And
Ronald could do what I used to do with a little
practice. Loan me those skis, young man, and
I’ll show you a thing or two!”</p>

<p class='c007' >Mack, open-mouthed, passes his skis over.
Ronnie, meanwhile, is struggling to get back up
the hill. He can’t make it on skis and is in
snow up to his waist. His dad kneels down and
slips his feet into the straps as we gaze at him,
darn near paralyzed. What can we say? Mr.
Turner is boiling mad ... so mad that he gets
one ski on backward. He kicks it off and turns
it around.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Excuse me, Mr. Turner,” breaks in
Tommy, “but hadn’t you better come back here
on the hill? Don’t put your skis on while you’re
on the slope. You might start off before you’re
ready. You know, skis don’t have any
brakes...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Are you telling me something about skis,
young man?” is Mr. Turner’s rejoinder.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m trying to,” replies Tommy, backing off,
“but I guess it doesn’t matter much. You’ll
find out soon enough.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Mr. Turner glowers.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Careful, Dad!” cries Ronnie, who comes
panting up the hill. “It’s not so easy as it
looks!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Stand back, son!” orders Mr. Turner, and
stands up suddenly. The incline starts him
moving and off he goes—before he’s ready.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Dad!” yells Ronnie, but there’s none of us
near enough to catch him.</p>

<p class='c007' >Mr. Turner gives one anxious glance behind
him, and almost falls over backwards as he
swoops downward. What’s worse—he hasn’t
had a chance to steer himself and he shoots off
the straight-away at once, going more and more
to the left.</p>

<p class='c007' >“He’s heading for the creek!” we all cry.
“Sit down, Mr. Turner! Sit down!”</p>

<p class='c007' >When you sit down it helps slow you up and
you can usually manage to stop although you
may roll over a few times. But it’s better than
running into something by a whole lot.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Maybe he’ll jump the creek!” speculates
Mack. “It’s only about fifteen feet across!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I don’t think my Dad was ever on skis before!”
says Ronnie, worriedly. “He thinks
anything a boy does is easy.”</p>

<p class='c007' >We groan at this, though I’m willing to believe
that Mr. Turner has had some experience
with skis which he hasn’t thought worth mentioning
until this moment. It’s even steeper
down the left side of the hill than it is down the
center where we’ve made our course, and Mr.
Turner is going like the wind when he gets to
the bottom. We can tell that he sees the creek
and is trying to figure out how he can avoid it.
He tries to move his skis to the side and make a
turn but nearly upsets. Thirty feet from the
creek he lifts one ski off the snow and desperately
attempts to swing sidewise. Instead he
criss-crosses his skis, tangles up his legs, sits
down with a smack, and goes sliding right on,
clawing and scraping until he clears the bank
of the creek and sails out over the water to land
ker-splash in the middle.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Oh, boy—and is that water cold!” shivers
Mack.</p>

<p class='c007' >“He sure showed us something!” murmurs
Tommy.</p>

<p class='c007' >Say—if we were to be tanned the next minute
we can’t help screaming at this. It’s twice
as funny as Ronnie’s high dive what with Mr.
Turner sitting in the creek, with the water up
to his neck and one ski still clamped to his foot.
He doesn’t stay there long, though. He flounders
about till he can stand up and wades ashore,
climbing up into the snow which must feel
warm to him in comparison to the icy water.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Ha, ha, ha!” laughs Ronnie. “Dad didn’t
do as well as I did, did he?”</p>

<p class='c007' >Man, oh man! Is <em>this</em> a surprise? Here
we’ve just begun to feel bad for laughing outright
at Ronnie’s father and Ronnie busts a rib
himself. That makes us feel better ... but
Mr. Turner’s coming up the hill, leaving the
skis behind, so mad the water almost turns to
steam on him.</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’d better beat it!” advises Mack.</p>

<p class='c007' >“No, fellows! Stay here!” pleads Ronnie.</p>

<p class='c007' >“We’ve got to stick!” I orders. “We can’t
run out on Ronnie now!”</p>

<p class='c007' >So we stand our ground, expecting to get our
heads taken off the minute Mr. Turner gets to
us. He’s a sorry looking sight as he clambers up
the hill, falling down a couple times in the snow
when he loses his footing. Mr. Turner’s hanging
onto his dignity, though, for dear life ...
trying his darnedest to preserve it. He’s been
humiliated in the eyes of his son and before a
bunch of fellows who’ve come from the best
homes in town, if I do say it. But all I can think
of is what my Dad told me about doing business
with Mr. Turner, in warning me not to make
him sore. And now I’ve gone and done it!</p>

<p class='c007' >“Gee, Dad!” says Ronnie, when Mr. Turner,
puffing hard and teeth chattering, reaches the
top of the hill. “If you knew how funny you
looked!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m c-c-cold!” answers Mr. Turner. “This
is no l-l-laughing m-m-matter! You b-b-boys
had no b-b-business....”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’m sorry, Mr. Turner,” I apologizes, thinking
of my father and hoping to straighten things
out.</p>

<p class='c007' >“S-s-sorry, n-n-nothing!” stammers Mr.
Turner. “You’ll b-b-be t-t-telling this all over
t-t-town...!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Sure they will,” says Ronnie. “It’s too good
to keep.”</p>

<p class='c007' >Mr. Turner glares furiously. “W-w-when
I w-w-want your opinion, son, I’ll ask f-for it!”
he returns.</p>

<p class='c007' >Have you ever been so nervous that you
can’t keep your face straight even when you’re
scared? That’s the way we feel and we commence
to snicker again, one fellow starting off
the others. It’s some comical sight, Mr. Turner,
shaking like a wet rag on a clothesline.</p>

<p class='c007' >“I’ve g-g-got to be g-g-getting to the
h-h-house,” he says. “B-b-boys, p-p-please
d-d-don’t s-s-say anything about this! K-k-keep
m-m-mum!”</p>

<p class='c007' >It’s so funny to hear Mr. Turner trying to
talk that Mack laughs right out.</p>

<p class='c007' >“Maybe,” suggests Ronnie, taking his
father’s arm, “if you’d let the boys use the
hill...?”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Yes!” takes up Mr. Turner, giving us an
appealing glance. “If I’ll l-l-let you use this
h-h-hill for a s-s-slide, w-w-will you b-b-boys
keep this quiet?”</p>

<p class='c007' >We look at one another and are we happy?
There’s a nodding of heads and I says: “That’s
a bargain, Mr. Turner! Nobody hears about
this if we can play on the hill!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“M-m-my w-w-word is my b-b-bond,” says
Ronnie’s Dad. “C-c-come on, Ronald, b-b-before
I s-s-suffer from exposure!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Goodbye, fellows!” calls Ronnie, and
winks. “I’ll be seeing you soon!”</p>

<p class='c007' >“Goodbye, Ronnie!” we shout after him, deciding
right then and there that he’s a regular
guy in the making.</p>

<p class='c007' >That night, when my Dad finds where I’ve
been he says, “How come?” and my answer is:
“Oh, Mr. Turner just decided, if he didn’t let
us use the hill, that everybody in town would
think he was all <em>wet</em>....”</p>

<p class='c007' >“I don’t quite understand,” my Dad replies,
but that’s nothing—because no one, outside of
our bunch, understands to this day.</p>
